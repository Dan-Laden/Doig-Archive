 Doig355 ENDINGS t ithe tongue of the silence that beats in you when you first know that a parent is dying and it will begin to recite everything unsaid across a lifetime Unsaid that even in our most desperate time when you were plunging into that wrongheaded marriage with Ruth and poisoning us away from the one you have come to call Lady you somehow kept to the one great rightness as the constant clasp of keeping me at your side whatever the place or the hour or the weather or the mood or task or venture So swiftly did you have me grown beyond my years that neither of us entirely understood the happening of it but knew it to be rare a triumph and terribly needed it was you in your burring troubadors way of passing to me all you knew of the valley and the Basin who enchanted into me such a love of language and story that it has become my I know if have never Doig356 said that as I stepped off from you to books and schools you somehow saw yourself riding free from the Basin stead and so had not a word for me but in praise encouragement proudnessrJ1hat I know and again could not speak it how drastically you turned your own life for me choking down pride as never before to speak the truce with Ladyrf1 know too that when you risked that truce time upon time it was because you needed risk needed somehow to sizzle ordinariness by dropping danger into it now and againffJknow and could say least of all the final fact of triumph that you and Lady had made your way to a cherishing of each other which went beyond family lineament Then the first and only words of this which would say themselves as they did now in my own voice Dad weve got to find the doctoring for you Late or soon the siege of must clamp itself around every family and never the same for any two I see now that ours had begun its queer quiet trenching some time before it could be recognized for all it was There is this tremor from the Christmas week of 1963 when Dad and Grandma came to spend the holiday with me in Decatur Before their train trip back to Montana I drove them north to Chicago for a weekend at last to show them the Northwestern House the school of journalism the cathedraltowered library Lake Michigan Doig357 lapping beside it all like an unexpected ocean1 which had filled five years of letters to of them were untiring sightseers and the mornings saunter of the campus pleased us all brought us proudly together in the accomplishment of having laddered me to such a place We went next to our hotel in downtown Chicago and in the snapping cold of the sunlit afternoon a moment when I thought the city looked its ponderous best I suggested we walk the surrounding blocks which offered the gaudy store the exotic bulk Institute windows of Michigan Avenue the skyline above the street canyons Grandma eyed everything with her mixture of suspicion and sharp interest asking me explanations to why the sid walks were so wide and the people so fastpaced But Dad I remember looking across at him in surprise as if finding a stranger with us when he suddenly said he had had enough he felt short of breathon the way back to the hotel he had to stand and breathe deep time after time the three of us a knot of concern in the grain of sidewalk traffic Once he said worry thick damnedblockqBut inside in his voice the warmth of the hotel as I was set to call for a doctor Dads chest eased at once he became himself and made a joke about Chicago being too cold for a sane man to walk around in anyway And like him not knowing what more to find in itnLoften enough through his Doig358 life he had felt mild dampweather discomforts in his lungs breakage of those horseback accidents and from his decades of heavy smokingir wrote off the moment to the stabbing chill of the winter lakefront Then late in the next spring weeks before I was to step into the editing job at The Rotarian a bulletin from Grandma Dearest Ivan Well dear one I have to write you that Dad isnt none too good He is in the hospital in Gt Falls they told him he has to quit smoking or else I am here with him but hes so awful weak and coughing so Phone calls told me that he was not in danger at the moment The hospitalization indeed was to begin easing him away from cigarettes and out of the coughing spells that were becoming chronic When I hurried to Montana between the end of my old job and the beginning of the new he told me the rest himself Once out of the hospital and at home in Ringling he had laid one fresh pack of cigarettes on the end table beside his easy chair When he could no longer stand it he smoked a cigarette Some days only one other days two but never more than two When the pack had emptied itself he took that as the moment when he had finished with cigarettes for all time Hardest damn thing I ever did ye know that But I did er Dads nerves jumped worse than ever now which was saying much and he looked like a thinner replica of himself Doig 359 but his appetite was gaining and he felt he soon could be doing some parttime work Well dont rush things I said uneasy with myself for feeling there was more that ought to be said Yet the doctors were finding nothing alarming Dad seemed merelyRif that word was right for any trouble beneath the breastbonea man who had got in the habit of oversmoking and needed to be weaned from its eventual dangers This quick braid of times together then before it came clear that my father was in serious illness I finger apart their pattern here because these are the momentstrands each of us will think of afterward and wonder Did I miss there some hint some flicker of doubt or pain or incredulity which told what was to come And the greater wondering beyond that If not how can that skein of no apparent peril and the skein which followed it be portions of the same life For now calamity began to make itself known as rapidly as if it had been invented entirely for Dad a man who lived on his feet he was finding himself shorter and shorter of breath after each briefest stint of walking At first the doctors he saw suggested that he might have a kind of asthma There was all the grief on earth in that verdict with its convulsed echoes of my mothers agony Yet Dad showed none of the wheezing attacks which so devastated lung difficulty nagged less violently but more steadily Land the diagnosis shifted It was Doig 60 sometime late in 1966 the year Carol and I had arced our lives to the Pacific Northwest that a word neither he nor I had heard before was uttered to my father emphysema In my mechanical way I read all I could find about the affliction and each word more brought its own gloom Emphysema it emerged could become a torture of the body beyond even my mothers suffering or the hol caust of cancer itself As the honeycomb of air sacs in the lungs was destroyed by it breathing would become forever more labored a constant struggle against a sensation of suffocating The act of breath would deliver less and less oxygen to the bloodstream overload the heart into harsher and harsher pumping Until the recent past emphysema usually had been confused with asthma or bronchitis and it had the worst of those increasing wheeze well as its own cycle of deterioration in the deeps of heart and lung Somehow through the null medical overdistension difficulty of exhalation excess came to picture the disaster happening in my fathers lungs as a pattern like the splotched burning of a sagebrush fire Perhaps it was the years of blue haze drifting up from his cigarettes that made me think so of smolder and slow whatever reason the image came to me io of the black turf such a fire spreads in its steady searing Doig361 fan across the land and the thought too that there would be no greening in this fires wake as time passed Only char and more char And the role those words and that image spoke for me For the dozen years since I had faced away from a storm blasted band of sheep on the Blackfeet Reservation this father of mine and shown me that they which was a tremendous assumption unveeringly had life Then too by the books and schooling I piled up I was granted to be the authority on the world outside Montana If I happened to be on the scene when Grandma was writing one of her letters to her son in Australia she still would ask me as she had when I was eleven how to spell some Down Under mystery such as kangaroo if I had told her qynguru she would have thought it odd of the Aussies correct because I had said it When I wrote an article about rodeo and put in a few lines about Dads own days he passed the marvel around to friends until the magazine wore out That kid of mine can write if I do say so myself unarguably saying so Beyond that there was my becalmed temperament amid the pair of theirs which swayed and whanged 4rt all said that now I must truly become the authority in the family this time on a matter beyond all of us Here was the turn of time sooner by a decade than I ever could Doig 362 have imagined when I must become ather to my own father and I feared the matter and wrestled it and began to do it I sent along to Montana the levelest words I could draw from what the medical journals and texts said of emphysema and the two conclusions which I said demanded doing winnow until we had the most expert diagnosis and advice we could find about this mystery licking its way inside Dad and move him from the blizzardy isolation 0 Ringling nearer to me di cal care of these Dad himself took on as if snapped from Almost overnight he found and A bought a small frame house in White Sulphur Ungrand as it was and carrying a sheaf of deeds which showed that it long had been a quick waystation for a procession of souls who couldnt afford better at the moment the house nonetheless improf on the Ringling shanty in size and warmth and all else Grandma was uneasy about the move Dont we get by good enough as we are Gee gosh at our age buyin another house and all I was the one to woo her from that Carol said once If you told her you were going to run an opium den she would come around onto the side of opium dens As promptly as I had Grandma persuaded out of Ringling she flung into tidying and floweredding the new month after she and Dad moved in it looked as if the pair of them had lived there from time out of mind Yet one of them was not going to live any time at all unless care for emphysema could be found and the next piece Doig363 of persuasion was to keep Dad from throwing himself under surgical knives An operation he had heard of was claimed to lift the sensation of heavy breathing already the pus Ii ing effort needed to make his lungs work was dismaying him Im sure Ive to lose b ut Ivan y phone and letter I found doctor after doctor against the surgery Guardedly carefully I brought Dad around from the idea of the operation and to agreeing that he would come to Seattle to be examined at a highlyreputed clinic as quickly as I could arrange it In his mind I believe glinted the hope that he could somehow be rescued into wholeness again as he had been on the operating table at the Mayo Clinic sixteen years before In mine was simply the vague medical prayer that the emphysema could be slowed eased I desperately wanted him not to be savaged into the worst of what the disease could inflict He was scheduled for several days of tests at the clinic The first morning I noticed Grandma putting on her best shoes and said to her without thinking I can stay with him down there itll be a long day The iron tone I had heard so many times I might just as well be there as setting around here like a bump on a log Each day and all day the pair of us lobbysat I thumbed magazines and tried without showing it to watch her beside me She kept her eyes on the waiting patients studying the ones who could hardly puff their way across Doig364 the room to the reception desk who sat hunched with their chests swelling in and out for each windy breath who into the waiting elevator with a nurse balancing an Dad appeared there was the relief a quick lifting in the both of us of seeing that he was toddled them at so much sturdier than the others his ranchmans stride almost too bold among the gaspy shuffles And again we would set off with him up or down the identical floors of the clinic to the next probing testtoften he would come back to the reception area in surprise That wasnt so bad they just had me lay down under some machine Could of had a nap except it was so damn cold But other times he arrived pale and grim and taut They gave me one of those damn barium deals and I heaved it right back up Grandma would give her resentful Hmpf against the clinics dosing such torment into anyone and I would try to talk him calm keep him seated with us until the whiteness went from that handsome uneasy face Then the three of us would move through the clinic once more like a search party off to the next lair of apparatus for Dad to patrol into for us Eventually the tests were finished and adjudged Dad and I waited in the doctors office this day Grandma had not wanted to come had said I should be alone with The slim room was as neutral and toneless as if we were the qA r Doig365 first visitors ever to have been sent into it like ne ra comers into a vacuum chamber But outside the one thin dow and below the clinics roothold on its hill the towers of the city marched to the dockside and then the blue of Puget Sound pooled rimming far off at a shore of timber and peaks My father my one closest pulse back into time sat looking at the towers and the blue and the stabbing mountains Finally he said in the worrying burr I had heard fret over vanished sheep and surprise blizzards and much else Im just afraid of what hes gonna say Skavinsky But the doctor spoke some surprise more texture of hope in his words at least than I had been able to allow myself I Of coursefthe harshest firstMLthe diagnosis was confirmed as emphysema Yes Dads life would be more labored Several times a day he would have to breathe deep into his lungs a medicine misted out of a machine to walk only in short stints learn to pace doctor paused went possible Dad a move to a ower altitude would be best r tk it isnt possible Im too far along in life doctor nodded as if he had known what that answer would be went on with his medical judgments Dads heart as yet showed little damage not yet the expected overwork caused by emphysematous lungs it pounded in him as strongly as that of a man half Doig366 his age His lung capacity still was considerable His general health was remarkable for a person who had gone through his batterings Grandma demanded the news as quickly as we arrived home I watched Dad to see how he would deliver it how drastically the prospect of a hobbled life was going to veer him He gave his cocked grin This doctor now I dont know about him If I was in as good a shape as he says I am I wouldnt be sick atall But when Dad and Grandma returned to Montana his lungs soon enough gave trouble He did learn to struggle more successfully with the emphysema walk some uncertain line between too much activity and incapacity But emphysema now brought an ally bronchial infection which hit Dad again and again in the chill of the valleys autumn and winter Now there were hospital stays for him time upon time the 45mile trip out of the valley and across the Big Belts to the hospital in Townsend A pattern began like codes spoken by a people in war Dad would suffer a new infection in his lungs By telephone from Seattle I would try to gauge how severe it was If Grandma guardedly said Hes just none too good in all he Vas ill enough to be hos pi talized again I would say Youd better let me talk to him now hating the long moments it took for him tocreep to the phone Hullo son how are you How am I Leave that unanswerable begin Doig 367 my questions calming gentling God Ivan I dont know what I better do Now persuade him around to going to the hospital tell him I will get free for a week to help out when he comes hometlf At last from him All right son whatever you say Whatever I say I could say all in the world except the magic we needed that if he did this certain thing his lungs would heal he would not gasp for every atom of air He would not die this most grudging of deaths Yet it was not a time of steady gloom I think that is the true grief of itLthat the four of us could glimpse the richness of life available if the haunting gape in Dads lungs did not return again and again The one pastimewithoutexertion left to Dad was trout fishing and the valley in or proffering who would wet lines railroad ruthlessly with him from daybreak to midnight if he worker retired from tending the tracks which coiled between Ringling and Sixteen Leo was a thick slab of a man whom it was uproarious to think of in the nickname of that job a gandy dancer Somethingii1 rumor said it had been a gassing on a World War One battlefield although I counted years and couldnt find him old enough11 had erased every hair on his head including eyebrows Out of that blank ball of head came a high crackling voice and an Oklahoma accent when he and Dad were out on a creek r Doig368 or lake the vicinity jangled with Leos sentences as if broadcasts were shrilling in from some rim of space For his part Dad accepted with wryness his reliance on windbroke as an old nag but that Oklahoman gets me to wherever theres a fish dont think he doesnt Once Carol and I went with the pair of them to a favored lake and as we hiked the hilltops circling their fishing water Leos voice racketed along with us as if he were at our elbows instead of half a mile below Dads murmur came in like a far purl of stream I hold that exact scene like a photo Dad and his bald bear of a friend in the yellow rubber raft at the lakes center a cone of color in the dusky retina of water while Carol and I listen to the steady crackle of fishing talk and grin down over the tasseltops of sage In that first year or two of affliction there were Ilg times even apart from his fishing outings with Leo when Dad could find periods of almostunforced breathing Seated in his big livingroom chair in the White Sulphur house his flat back and level shoulders square against the fabric he could recline and talk with only a hinting riseandfall of his chest as if he had just rapidly walked a block or tell ye a time he might begin then if the nudge of encouragement came from me or more likely from Carols presence for he found this new Doig 369 daughterinlaw a dazzling bonus to the familyf I was ridin S out here for the Dogie and I happened to look up into a little park there in the Castles and saw a bunch of elk going across I counted five of them As the Dutch fellow says as many as the thumbs on the end of mine hand So I thought well this ridin can go to hell for a little while Ill just see about those no longer could work at all except to do the smallest repairs around the house but the loss of that fiftyyear habit of effort seemed to dismay him less than I had thought it would He spent time reading watching Grandma as she fussed at flowerbeds until she had a moat of color around almost all the house somehow making himself fit so mild a routine of in other ways surprising disquiets might break out of him now Never a very political man and hardly a sympathizer with the strange longhaired counterculture which had begun to prance before him on the livingroom television set Dad was furious and bitter about the clubbings at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago Godamighty I thought this was a country where the police werent supposed to beat up on people The war in Vietnam worked confusions on wanted not to see his country lose a war and yet What the hell is it we want over there anyway It was as if with sickness fastened into his own chest he saw any sickness of the nation all the more sharply Doig 370 Time was carving fast at one in that Montana household and hardly at all on the other In her oaken way Grandma went on now as if age didnt apply to her At the start of the summer of 1968 when Carol and I had come to White Sulphur for Grandmas175th birthday Dad declared If I ever reach 75 shell still be up and pushing me around in a wheelchair ven now she was bolstering his life in dozens of ways tending nursing scolding puzzled by whatever had taloned into Dads lungs but automatically ready to do all that his situation demanded And almost as if she had the impulse to push back against the grayness settling over Dads life she now began to turn out vivid her years of crocheting Dad and I encouraging and admiring noises and I often marveled that she could follow the tiniest intricacies of pattern But I had never cared much for the frilly doilies and lacy tablecloths that flew from her needle regarding them as something like her everlasting games of solitaire played in thread But the quilting flamed away any opinions of that sort What Grandma turned out now in the living room as Dad watched from his haven of chair danced with brilliant colors snippedand9sewn diamonds of ragwork marching and playing and jostling like a meld of rainbows or some resplendent field of tiny flags from all the universe To come out of our ungaudy family this was an absolute Doig371 eruption of bright art and I blinked in wonder at this grayhaired woman I thought I knew so entirely For her part Grandma simply produced each quilt demanded Now then isnt that pretty and gave it to Carol and me or someone in her sons families When we all had quilts galore she And across seven hundred miles in and I settled to our own changed life Carol rapidly had maneuvered from one job to the next and always up within a year after our arrival she had a professorship teaching journalism at a community college I was making my expedition through three solid years of reading and seminar work to the professorship of my own11one slogstep to the next 41Along dying the only way I have ever known to get a thing done with that trudged the decisions needed for Dad The of a parent is a time without answers only anguished guesses and I wished that I were an older and wiser guesser able to come onto some angle of insight which would declare Here this is to be done I wished a thousand useless longings and amid them made whatever small tactics I could reason out The main guidance I set in myself was that Dad should not be written off not be allowed to write himself off as an invalid It may even be that in following this notion during his first few years of emphysema not enough Doig 372 allowances were made for his illness But he was surrounded in the family by three of the worlds dogged souls and he woes qfDeeper himself had persevered through past health than that lay the belief also endlessly mulled in me that it would be preferable for him to pace out an active but shorter life rather than an inert lingering We could not talk about this in so many words La failing in our family perhaps yet none of us ever had seen much reason to say made my father as much with hi ife Occasionally my estimates of how much Dad could be encouraged to do would overrun his capacities During one of their visits to Seattle Dad and Grandma were taken by us across Puget Sound on a fine afternoon to a play given in an outdoor theater I had known that the theater seats were spaced down a I did not know was that there was a descent of fore di vru the topmost of the seating1f Grandma was and fretful during the play I had said We 11 get him out of here somehow dont worry about it Although Dad had continually said he was sure he could make the slope by taking it slow he must have been edgy about it as well Starting up he at once went breathlessfcarol and I looked at one another he was going to have to be carried out I went to the stage borrowed a straightbacked Doig 373 chair from the set Seating him in it Carol I lifted the chair between us and started up the trail t made an awkward and severe load which we denied over and over and in our gritting paired exertion we took him out of there like a potentate At the top he could walk perfectly well on level ground In double relief I panted Told you wed get you out somehow And the episode did prove that if shakily thing more soon was proved that when it was needed we could draw together the strongest of family thews live as a single household The main decision as so many others by then was mine and I came to it reluctantly believing so entirely in the independence of lives But there was the greater belief that my father way must be helped in whatevelJpossible to live and so in the autumn of 1968 I arranged that Dad and Grandma would come to Seattle to stay with Caroland me until the spring Neither of them wanted the move It would uproot them from everything familiar Yet they saw that it was as dergo another mauling winter of J e mild coastal climate was the chest infection measure against that on my word they came When the pair of them had unpacked I suddenly asked What did you do with Spot Leave him with somebody Grandma answered slowly No There was nobody right to Doig 374 take care of him and we knew we couldnt bring him with so had him done away with The day before they left she had asked Dad Spots lifetime foe and idol to take the dog to the veterinarian Id rather have through a beating my father said now in mY living the as the but he had done the task petted needles sleep crept through the dog had him buried car rQ fully on a ridge above the valley4I turned and walked to the bathroom locked the door turned a faucet full on and wept For a jaunty dog for my beset family which could not be spared even this being able to meet grief only in my own company this way I think now that Dad and Grandma settled into our expanded household with less tension than I did Not that there wasnt much for them to wonder at in the unpredictable new locale Day and night ambulances would howl along a street below us on their way to the hospital which treated burn cases Carol and I had stopped hearing the banshee sound of them after our first few weeks in the house Grandma heard every one hmpfing each time think of yet another disaster in this severe did she ever accustom herself to the telephones blat from the kitchen each time it jangled she started in surprise which in turn twitched Dads nerves From him What are ye jumping about From her Gee gosh I cant help it and Doig 375 whatre jumping about yourself flhe telephone skirmish was daily sometimes almost hourly but betweentimes the pair of them passed the day more smoothly than could have been foreseen Much of the morning they sat at the livingroom table Grandma playing her offhand solitaire Dad pointing wordlessly whenever she overlooked a card to play the both of them glancing every few moments out of the window to the city and its unending tributaries of traffic A crew came to work on the railroad tracks nearby and Dad studied their labors by the hour He noticed that the heftiest of the workers arrived and went with great irregularity and began an ironic game of foremanning him from the livingroom I would arrive home from the university for lunch and be told My man was ten minutes late again this morning Im gonna have to jack him up about this bein late all the time and all the time The next noon Hes gettin better my man is Only about five minutes late this morning Ill get a full day of work out of him yet one of these times Dad had a grimmer game for himself each late afternoon ri The doctor had ordered him to walk as far as he could every day At first he would come back from fifty yards down the street desperate out of breath Godamighty I cant walk any more than a baby But the next day he would try again Grandma seldom went with him on these efforts did Doig376 ould not offer to go have to attle for They both accepted that breath by himself At last an afternoon when I was on my way home from the university library and met him several blocks from the house and at the base of the slope which skirted away below our neighborhood As I came up to him Dad was panting but able to say I told myself Id work up to w alki ngthis farandIv edtofind my words for acclaim Hell then youre just a lot stronger than you were The doc will be tickled with you But he shook his head as if he could not afford to admit triumph I know I cant do much This is a helluva way to have to live creeping along weak as a kitten I had no words at all for that and we started for home silently paired in his trudge To describe that halfyear of the four of us under a go far toward an understanding of it an understanding to be had only reactions reflexes well enough yet none of us wanted to Carol picked her way through the situation the best of us all turning the snappishness between Dad and Grandma with amusement granting Grandma the share of chores she sought even confounding one of Grandmas sayings No kitchen is big enough for two women at once More than any of the Doig 377 rest of us perhaps Carol simply remained herself Grandma I think felt entirely unrooted She missed family and friends missed the gossip and lifepattern of the valley missed a house of her own missed everything there was to miss of sixty years spent in Montana Dad seemed tugged between his past and the life I was trying to make for myself He met our citified friends more easily followed my university work more interestedly Yet he did not manage to feel settled and adjusted either uneasy with the torrents of people he saw rivering along streets and sidewalks the lockstep of houses thousand upon thousand any of the dimensions of the city For my part I felt again the crowdedness I had tried to pull myself away fromkfrom a toosmall prairie sheep wagon from the halfhouse in Ringling from so many unprivate places so much of those Montana years Relation J ships between me and both Dad and Grandma were richer and fuller than I had expected they always were 11 yet I still fiercely wanted what I so long had wanted all my own in life With spring came the declaration from Dad and Grandma that they were ready to return to Montana I agreed The winter had worked out to plan Dad had escaped all chest infection he was very much stronger than when he had he seemed better able to cope with the emphysema Doig378 the trip to Montana with them in 811 to keep Dads nerves steady for the time ahead of him In a matter of a few months Dads proppedup health plunged apart The chest infection hit there was pitalization again But worse daybyday signs of failure started to show now He began to fall deep asleep any time of the day for alarming IJJ4 Ls then be unable A to close his eyes at night1Grandma saw this in astonishE ment then fury No wonder you cant sleep at night slee 0 ing all day long too Gee gods Get up and around and youd get over that sleepyheadedness His usual answer was to sit forward for some minutes with his head in his hands despairing then to fall back again as if exhausted I checked with his doctor at the clinic and was provided the unbrambled version of Grandmas viewpoint Dad was in carbon dioxide narcosis caused by his lungs failure to rid themselves of their afterbreath wastes The carbon dioxide residue worked like a slowing drug in his bloodstream The remedy was for him to get up walk ride an exercise bicycle anything to get the deadening pumped from demanded exactly when he felt least able to make any This period of narcosis with Dad asleep hour upon hour and his skin color with a dangerous hint of bluing in it like some dark seepage beneath ice was the most Doig 379 terrifying yet It seemed very much like death practicing vie on him We were in a time the deadly A gullying in my fathers lungs of my grandmothers failing chance to bolster his life of to find medical help which would make much difference now My father day upon day lay back in his big chair in the livingroom in White Sulphur and gilled in air as if out of breath from the long stopless run through life But that it was not stopless each of us knew too could read that in the bulk of the oxygen tanks which came oftener and oftener into the house now I can chart my fathers last years by the medical apparatus that attached itself to his existence The first the machine that blew a fog of medication into his lungs sat at his bedside with much larger some innocence A bland than a typewriter the device awaited him several times a day took in his puffs of exertion and traded out its mysterious mist sent him use sparingly a minute or so of relief at a time into his lungs a few times a day But across the months the oxygen imbibing became oftener longer Grandma was at her most baffled and furious with this terrifying new addiction Doig 380 Charlie the more of that you use the more you just want to use He gave her a weary fury back I cant help using it Ive got to breathe And in the next minute she would have gone to the kitchen to bring him a cup of coffee and he would have thanked her softly and the helpless ness would have passed for the moment The one winner was the oxygen which the next day would tether him a few moments longer At last came the time when he slumped in the chair with the oxygen tether forever in his nose slept with it All had been reversed from the outset when he was bolstered by a few minutes of oxygen each day now there were only a handful of moments when he could bear to be without it Everything now had thinned to the whiffs holding him in life like a breeze scudding a dried leaf barely above the ground MEdlli lf a Mi Egli Wi gqpt the pHliil from the metill longer could he even make a recuperative trip to Seattle the doctor said there was medical risk in travel and Dad felt the greater risk in himself could not bring himself to such a COn one of my Montana trips back again in the house in White Sulphur after the bleak task of having delivered Dad into another hospital stay Grandma said out of the blue Dad asked me never to let you put him in a rest home Doig 381 I said nothing for a long minute which of course said that I had thought of it What reply I eventually made to her I no longJl know but it was not definite enough for either of usftThat was the problem11to be definite in the unclearest of moments Here was fact my father was hop lessly afflicted every breath a fresh agony Here was proposition warehouse him as the presence he was becoming But then here was judgment whose benefit would it be for Not Grandmas Not his own Mine In the end I turned decision back on itself Not to choose the one crevicecrossing was to choose the other I stayed by a conviction that had been forming silently in the best that could be done in this desolate situation was to help this beset pair Dad and Grandma endure through it together in their own home Across twenty years I had watched the two of them wear grooves into each other until at last the fit of their lives became a mutual comfort a necessity between t f them Their time together had passed through armistice into alliance and on to acceptance then to affection and at last had become one of the kinds of lovetflr saw that now even as I had missed seeing the early signs of the procession Now my father leaned his very life on my grandmother on her care of him When his life toppled away as it must soon a presence would go out of Doig 82 my grandmothers existence like something lacking in the air of her own breathing This told me all the more that as long as he yet lived as long as Grandma had the health and verve to care for him at she should She was in some ways the oddest put together A as she was of a fast temper and oblique notions of illness and its she still was sturdy still had E to keep herself busy every moment that she was not asleep And there was that fiercest of all her capacities her ability to prop other lives with her own I lacked her knack for such entire sacrifice her habit of putting all else before her own needs The most I could do for my father was to warehouse him in my own home assuming he could be gotten there or within other Grandma if I allowed her could do very much more What that tokened to me was that as long as Dad could remain in known surroundingsin the valley in the house he had chosen and bought with this woman he had come to such deep alliance with for whatever little was left of his L unheardof equations to this time qft life he should There were other For one Dad had become both thinner and and hands going gaunt but the exertions of his lungs building his chest out to a broad shell an encasement as if heft from everywhere else in his body had been summoned there The great chest of course was a cruel fake the muscles r Doig 383 which had stretched out and out to squeeze air into the failing lungs still were unable to pull in the torrent of and the more barrellike Dad became the more A grudgingly breath dragged in and out of him For another my father stayed in the moments of my days steadily now even as his body dwindled from me All of his way of life that I had sought escape grindstone routine of ranching the existence at the mercy of mauling weather the endless startingover from one calamity or passing with him and while I still wanted my distance from such a gauntlet I found that I did not want my knowing of it The perseverance to have lasted nearly seventy years amid such cold prospects was what heritage Dad for me I had begun to see that it counted for much Through all this ran the zipperlike whisper of history as well Dads time pan and even the late portion of it when I was growt ing up at his side quickly was being peeled away by change To my constant surprise in our years in the north and the time I was away at Sulphur had swapped itself from being a livestock town to a logging town Each time I drove in now across the long deck of the valley the blue plume of smoke from the sawmills scrap burners at the edge of town startled me made me wonder for an instant whose house had caught fire Out from town along the forks of Doig 384 the Smith River and beneath the flanks of the Castles and Big Belts the ranches were being reached by the conti ental metamorphosis from agriculture to agribusiness No longer were there the summers haying crews Dad had manned so many times only a few men on galloping machines Nor were there any longer the dozens of sheepherders nor the roving shearing crews because there no longer were sheep we are a people swathed in synthetics now1Even the sagebrush the very coloration of that sohigh prairie country was beginning to be erased under potent new plows and tractors and farming theories the topsoil which had defeated the homesteaders now laid back like a pelt being skinned offf And beyond even that the large valley ranches which to my mind had croupiered an area that could have sustained many mediumsized ranches into a single fistful of huge holdings were beginning to notice a bigness beyond their own corporate America Ye know who owns the Dogie now Dad demanded indignantly when I arrived on one of my visits A Such matters began to align in these first few years of the struggle with Dads affliction into the last and most unexpected of equations I was discovering myself to be more my fathers son and my grandmothers grandson than I had ever known Exactly at the point of my life when I had meant to turn myself to teaching to the routined Doig 385 assurances of scholarliness I found myself veering inward instead The university life was setting off in me the di Iquiets which had sent my father stomping time and again from the big ranches of the valley I recognized in myself like him I never was going to be comfortable about soldie ing for the large enterprises of the world and that unlike him I had the cache of education to provide some choice in the matter I was finding too that more of Grandmas fierceness of family was in me than was expected The nation was in wars I despised and fearedin Asian rice paddies in its own the obliteration raging against my own father was wh ltlOH vi Lal Le n18 much the co pelling battle coon Ji lit came slowly doggedly I kept on through the seminars and exams claimed the degree at the last dusty furrow of it allbut then I abandoned the offer of a job at one of the countrys largest universities Instead I began to work at writing by the shaggiest and most marginal of its modes for magazines I offered to Carol I know you married me for better or worse but this is somewhere off the scale She answered as ever Do it Academic friends plainly were puzzled and a bit disturbed as if I had declared I was going off to be a wheelwright or a buffalorhunter When I undertook Doig 386 to explain myself during one of the Montana trips Grandma simply offered her blanket assumption that whatever I did made some sense all its own and Dad I noticed seemed to understand this drastic veer better than any other I had ever done At least he said yell be your own boss My fathers heritage of perseverance I have said At last the emphysema began to gnaw even that from him During another of my Montana stays more than four years now since the diagnosis of what was at work in Dads lungs a neighbor stepped in to visit As we sat in the and Grandma racketed in the kitchen to make coffee the neighbor remarked to Dad how good it was to see him up and around what relief it must be to be backfrom the hospital bed At once Dad made a futile tossing motion with his hand and told her My hearts just hanging by a thread7Jr i erel cJ lo1SlJ looked at him iR ilar7DQ everything else inside his chest was becoming a horror but time after time the doctors examinations had found that engine of a heart had not yet shown falter had withstood amazingly the fierce load on it Yet in one sense at least the heart truly was going out of him The desperation of having to fight for every breath of having to live tied by the nose to an oxygen tank of regulating himself more and more by all the medication that demanded to be taken simply h ad worn away his energy So long and labored a dying had drawn nearly Doig 387 all worth from his body and now it set in on his endurance of mind Again Dad began to yearn toward the surgery he had heard of when he first learned he had emphysema Again I investigated again gathered opinions again told him what I had found the surgery was considered doubtful his clinic doctor advised passionately against it So forlorn about his life was too generous a word for it nowMthat he had begun to base everything on the operation Dad was wrenchingly depressed at the latest advice against it Whatever you think son But I dont know how I can go on like I am vJ 2e ES J words battered in me for weolllt as I tried to weigh through the misery toying with him now think what could be spoken into that tortured hopeless life At last in early January of 1971 I wrote one more of my careful letters Saying I had come to believe that here was one decision which I could not make for him I would fly to Montana we would attempt whatever slight relief there might be for another recuperative spell in the listen hospitatjhen he felt able to decide I would and help him to weigh facts But the words of I decision finally would have to come from him this Out of that a phone call the day after my letter came to him it was Grandma saying that he had had the operation that morning Doig 388 The greatest fear I can imagine licked through me As I held the phone my hand shook the single time that had happened in my life At last I gulped in breath and said I would come to Montana at once When I arrived the next day Dad was breathing with less labor than I had seen him in for some time but he told me there had been a glorious after the operation when he had no sensation of breathing hard at all Ivan it was like I was a well man again Then he had begun to feel the labor creep back I sat with him the next few days urged him into a small routine of life again And heard the first cough from him like a scraping sound in the night By the end of a week he plainly was coming down with the lung infection again I despised the task as never before it took me the large part of a day to talk him into another hospital stint to plane time came and I stood to say goodbye sitting on the edge of the hospital bed A his dismay at being there once more mixed with the relief of drawing on steady oxygen and the familiar care He looked stronger than he had at home I turned in the doorfl soon say my usual parting Ill talk tE you on the phone Take care He said as ever ye son way to A Doig 389 The hospital stay did bolster him again did renew his strength and ease his lungs enough until as usual in about two weeks time he was able to go home to White Sulphur and Grandmas care once more He still struggled for breath but seemed somehow slightly more enduring than he had been And his prompt return home carried hope for the chronic collapses back into hospitalization had told me how he would die1f a last torturing confinement in the angled bed tubes looped to his body but breath eroing eroding despite all apparatus within the white sheets a sharp panting for life like my mothers agony reechoed then a gasp to stillness It would be the last terrible smother of his crippled lungs and I could see it in ta Y exactness but the moment on the calendar 0 t l vf J Sut he moment and was home once I more now away from winters usual pneumonia attacks That and other delvings for reassurance were on his jn midFebruary he sent to Carol and me his first letter in years Hi you two I am going to see if I can write you a short letter I am doing pretty good I think breathing seems to stay about the same My legs still are so darn weak but I am slowly getting a little more strength in them I am using the exercise bike all I can 4The page labored on in his taut ove writing but the news was in that slide of report doing pretty gooaiJ Doig 390 about the SaJllep1all r can1And soon after the ing lines of puzzle and suspicion from Grandma He doesnt seem to improve any Hes getting the same as before Sleep days and up and down all ni te Usually eats three sandwitches during the nite with milk But he doesnt eat a good meal For the thousandth time I thought through the spec re of his final hospital stay and readied myself for the news that I would have to come once more and deliver him to the prospect I had forgotten that the great constant in my father was surprise In early April on the third morning after Dads seventieth birthday Grandma stepped to his doorway to begin him on another day of existing At the bed he was on his back with his head and upper body tilted to the right his mouth open as if having turned to speak an answer over his shoulder In his custom now the bedcovers had been flipped aside because of their burden on his laboring chest His pajamas were scarcely mussed and the squarecut face was freed of its straining look And in the instant when his heart at last had convulsed in him and ended his life so silently and immediately that no hint of it could be heard in a room fifteen feet away his right arm had flung wide catching the tether of oxygen tube and tearing it from his nostrils By early afternoon I was i n Montana by dusk had m ade the burial arrangements that night slept in the bed where Doig 391 my father had died less than twenty hours before Grandma was tearyeyed steadier than I would have been from looking in on a body in the dawn light We both were startled after the dragging years of nearhelplessness at the staccato pace of everything to be done now Having arranged a furlough from her classes Carol flew in from Seattle propped us both with her efficiencyJILate in the second day the minister who would read the funeral service came to the house Across the years I can think of little more remote from my fathers range of mind than religion Once in my boyhood a pair of Jehovahs Witnesses had come to our door Dad gave them his levelest look proclaimed Were staunch Presbyterians here and had the door closed on the visitors before they could blink I gaped at him and received his jokecalculating giin Never knew we was did ye I certainly didnt and can think of no other time religion became a topic under our roof The funeral minister now found that I was a bland target for his tries at commiseration He soon asked what Bible reading I wished at the funeral service The one where God speaks to Job from the whirlwind Job 38 that would be He sat higher in his chair Its not a 1usual funeral choice I said nothing The first few verses I imagine The readings usually are brief No all of it All the chapter Were in no after these years He nodded offered a hand was gone I did not believe in funerals and the customs of public grief but I believed less in doing anything not understand tC ble to Grandma I braced and on the morning before the funeral drove her across town to the chapel to see Dad in his casket He looked milder than in life calm and unscarred except for the starprint in the center of his square chin She looked down at him gave a sob and said her one last sentence to him Oh Charlie why did you have to die Then the afternoon and across the chapel faces from two lifetimesAmy fathers my ownJhung row on row I looked out among them as the preachers words marched Where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth The lone black face of Taylor Gordon nodding softly to the Bible rhythms Cliffords head among the pallbearers undressed without his ranchers hat atop it Hast thou commanded the morning undark faces Dad had ridden with and foremanned on the Dogie and the Camas and a dozen other ranches paler faces from the saloons and stores Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow Faces from the Basin from winters a half century ago from homesteads gone empty and echoing Canst thou send lightnings Faces absent alive only in specific tales of death Doig 393 Nellie queerly quiet in the casket of his car battered by the rolling plunge from a hill road At a Canas ta table a heartattack astonish s McGrath he AM M er flings his cards as if sledge the chest topples bac ward as the jacks and queens flutter down upon him Kate and Walter Badgett each lying down in ancientness not to arise again but of course Walter passing first Kate watchfully next Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the appetite of the young lions d last always and always piercing through it all the memory of my mothers on the mountain my fathers life in a way having begun to end there where hers did And at last the procession to the cemetery the brief graveside ceremony quickly done in bitter A weather and the last glimpse of Dads casket within the walls of earth Nothing new can be said of the loss of a parent it all has been wept out a million million times During the funeral preparations and the days afterward I could find in myself only the plainest broadest of emotionsMLanger that Dad had suffered so steadily and so long relief that he was released from the squeezing bars of his own ribcage and that I was released from the guesswork decisions over his existence Those and the gratitude that of all interesting men I knew this one had been my father Doig394 Now there was Grandmas grief to be worked through On some footings she was as unshakable as ever When the chore came to choose a tombstone for Dads grave she startled me by saying at once that she wanted to be buried exactly beside him and to have her name on the same stone All right sure I offered Then she went silent for a minute and amended No not together on the stone Right alon side him a stone like his one We ought to each have our own gravestone but the same ut days after the funeral when the time neared that I would have to leave for Seattle again and we had talked through what she would she would fend alone in the house the bonus that her youngest son lived near enough to look in on her often the luck of having neighbors who fussed over herishe suddenly put in Maybe I could of done better Maybe I could of been better to Charlie he was so sick he words rivered out of me Good God you waited on him hand and foot these years you were theone person of any of us who could have done it Theres no blame on you and I never want to hear you saying there is I broke off choked by tears My sorare fury impressed her and one woe of this afterdeath was dispelled Others took more time When she arrived the next month for a stay with us in Seattle I came back from putting her suitcase away to find her standing in the living room weeping Everywhere I look I see Charlie here Doig 395 I had no fury for that only the stab of knowing how late the emotion of familyhood had come to us And for once in all these beset years I did know the cure for something Deliberately sometime during each day with her I brought made his life a gter of fact center of grief s she always conversation or another among us rather than a storm had Grandma firmed herself up As soon as she returned to Montana there were the words in her first letter that I read like a line of a song Im feeling pretty good now again and getting a little more straightened around every day Now that my grandmother was alone in the last of her odd widowhoods again I would have to divine across seven hundred miles how a life was holding up how much attention was wanted what decisions and soothings and temperings were needed Carol knew best the one clinching life was far from wife of one of my cousins during the swirl of the White Sulphur household after Dads death I worried the notion for awhile then began the phoning and letters needed and by mi could tender it to Grandma How would you like to go to Australia to see Paul Well send you She had been in an airplane only a few times had never flown alone never seen an ocean let alone been up over the Doig 396 never changed planes at vast terminals never A done twenty dozen impossible things she listed to me at once As I had known it took weeks to talk her toward the notionlthat yes it could be afforded yes I could handle mysteries of passport and visa no she was not too old although the fact of her seventyeight years haunted me no little at last came the question which I knew meant she would do it Do you think really I can go there all by myself I laughed into the phone the one last word needed Really Across half the earth in September of 1971 she was met in Australia by the son not seen for 25 years and by the daughterinlaw and three grandchildren entirely new to her Quickly her letters came in across the Pacific as if she was remaking the host land The flowers are so Nobody seems to pick them for boquets J but I do their so lovely I been teaching the kids card games Rummy and Solitare and they want to play all the time now I went downtown with Joyce this morning She said it was her pie day I couldnt see and couldnt see why she would go buy pies when we both bake good and finally I asked her She said No not that kind of pie she meant it was her pay day They sure talk a broge here dont they I grinned with the thought of her looking at kangaroos living with this newfound family in their house so queerly stilted above a Queensland flood plain going off with them to see salt mined from ocean water and to stand for her picture at a monument proclaiming something called the Tropic of Capricorn I dont just know what its all about but you will She sent me a clipping of what the newspaper there had written about her visit and I read it thinking they knew only the scantest fraction of this caller When she returned in a month Carol and I met her at the airport hugged her in triumph and admiration and hurried her to our house to sleep offfooo miles of flight The next morning she did not wake up until past eleven entirely scandalized Gee gods why didnt you get me up hours ago I lifted my eyebrows and tried to tell her about jetlag but for once she was having none of my explanations I never slept this late in my whole entire life she huffed and was on her feet The single thing I knew I had done properly in Dads last years was to keep him mobile as long as it could be managed Given Grandmas restless insistence to be as she would put it up and around and doing I thought that it was even more vital for her to stay active I had forgotten what an ally a small town such as White Sulphur could be in this Neighbors and friends and relatives kept an eye on her mowed her lawn delivered gossip to her kitchen table delivered Grandma herself to what became a prized new pastime for her a Senior Citizens Doig 398 Club When I visited the small house in Montana now I looked at the tacke up sheet of paper on which she scrawled the phone numbers of her support system saw it lengthen steadily and nodded in satisfaction The habit and patterns grew just in time for in the spring of 1972 a few days less than a year after Dads death Grandma suffered a heart attack1 the first blow on her health in her eight decades of life I flew to Montana to do the and housework when she came out of the hospita1ftshe was going to be I knew the worlds most restless convalescent and as soon as I had her seated in the house I started on her We are going to make a deal Im going to do all the work in this house for the next week or soher lips already flying open in protest and you can help me with these I showed her a shoebox filled with file cards the index material for a textbook Carol and I had just written All right she said in immediate purpose show me just what there is to the next several days she sat quietly and sorted and alphabetized as I hovered carefully out of the way At last she pronounced I think thats all of it Ivan I studied how much more vigorous and restored she had become smiled and said I think it is She recuperated briskly enough to go on living much as she had but to her disgust needed to rely on heart regulating pills Whenever she felt the first signs of Doig399 angina usually needlelike sensations at the tops of her arms she would pop a glycerine pill into her mouth as if it were an aspirin determinedly sit still for a few minutes and be up and at some chore again Outwardly she aged hardly at all I compare photos of her taken five years apart and they seem to have been snapped within the same minute the identical pursed smile beneath the resolute upper face and graywhite field of hair I found that now Grandma filled not only her own role 1 for me the one of standin mother begun twenty when she and I moved into the house in Ringling but what had been Dad11s as well my compasspoint to the past to my own youth Whenever she visited Seattle or I came to Montana she began to talk easily of the gone years to tell even of her marriage to Tom Ringer and of life on the Wisconsin mifla Was noe WallderingbackMitwas as solid and set on the chore of the moment as everHbut she seemed freed at last of the tempers which had covered over such stories True there still came bursts out of her which could have resounded at any point of her past sixty years in the valley Leave a light switched on in her house past early morning and you would hear hmpf burnin a hole in the daylight and the abrupt click A longhaired white cat had recognized her front porch as a provision port and he came and went battered from alley fights and matted with cockleburrs to the rhythm of her Doig400 feedings and scoldings But the time now Grandma was in mellower mood than I could ever remember as if old age was coming gently her in compensation for the way it had ripped apart took the chance to have her retell what I had heard from her as a boy confirm the details imprint her private wordings Before I quite knew it the cadences of this book had begun out of listening to her Listening and seeing for the one scribe of my familys past had been the Brownie box camera I dug out Grandmas photo albums which had gathered dust under one bed or another f5 Slpcjiy I remember one u1p1toe early evening spent 1IlJNlr house a hours praaA A as she went through for me an album which had belonged to my mother Picture upon picture of my father and motherrin their herding days on Grass Mountain on horseback at rodeos dressed up in finery beside the square hulks of 192 automobiles4brought sniffles or hardswallowed sentences from Grandma and by the time I had jotted my notes on the final page been putting into the room had worn me the emotion she had should be enough for tonight I said in a weary glaze She turned to me in surprise But we got these others to get through Hadnt we just as well to keep on And we did And then the moment for there always is such a pivot moment when it truly became clear how far along in life she was At the end of September 1974Lshe was Doig 401 by flew to Seattle to spend a few weeks with us When Carol and I saw her coming slowly up the ramp from the plane we waved she gave us her pursed smile Then she stopped and leaned against the wall of the ramp and I bolted toward her By the time I reached her she was fumbling the bottle of heart pills from her purse A pill and getting her to a chair eased the angina before long we were on our way but with her now a more fragile piece of life than she had been minutes before Time and again in that visit she had to sit and ease the heart symptoms But she would not be kept idle nor did I think she ought to be She had lived under the same roof with Dads helplessness a repeat of that would be the cruelest affliction that could happen to her And so I invented chores tasks she could do while sitting She clipped her way through mounds of newspapers to sort references for my writing files and her only complaint was that it wasnt work enough If two minutes of page flipping didnt yield a headline circled for clipping her mild grumble would come Ivan Im not finding none to cut out This visit of hers now had a sharp hook at the end of it I had written articles about the Worlds Fair in Spokane and Grandma longed to see it The plan had been that at the end of her stay Carol and I would drive her to Doig402 Spokane shepherd her around the Fair for a day and she would fly home to Montana from there Plainly her heart spasms were too chronic now for that but just as plainly this might be her last outing in the world And I believed more than ever seeing the determination with which she would take a heart pill sit briefly and then be back at some chore that helstride of life should be slowed as little as the end of her stay I gave her another of my decrees Theres just too much walking at the Fairgrounds The only way I see that you can go there is in a wheelchair She gave me her most mildly regretful Ohhh as if I had just told her it might rain sometime in the next week Then If you say so I expect never to have another inspiration click to the perfection this one did Grandma in her rented wheelchair as Carol or I propelled her instantly was eligiole to go ahead of every line into every exhibit She saw her Worlds Fair as effortlessly and grandly as if she were Queen Victoria somehow being trundled through time Gee gosh she said as Carol and I helped her into the car at the end of the day obviously pleased with herself and the pair of us that was sure the way to do that The next morning in the last minutes before she was to board her plane at the Spokane airport the awareness flew into m e as it always did now at these p artings that Doig403 here might be the last set of moments I would see Grandma alive Then total commotion near us had been an orderly family the mother saying goodbye to the husband and their four children as they set off for somewhere and suddenly the woman was grappling with the man and shrieking Ive got a restraining order Dont let him on this plane with my children As he tried to pull away she haltered him by his necktie and continued to shout The children erupted into a bawling swirl the smallest one was belly whopped to the floor amid the wrestling The airline workers were slow and reluctant to edge in on the battle 4I tried to talk Grandma calm as the brawl went on the picture of her sagging against the plane ramp when she had arrived in Seattle blazed in me But she said No Im all right and sat watching and giving her usual hmpf until the airline people could herd the roaring family to a side room Then it was time for me to help her down the ramp and to her plane seat and to smile a nervous goodbye to her one more time The phone call the metallic blat of worst news came three weeks later Again the flight to Montana the drive from Helena through the Big Belts to White Sulphur Springs for this last of the burials in the valleys cemetery Peter Doig Annie Campbell Doig Tom Ringer Berneta Ringer Doig Charlie Doig in a somber space not much larger than a garden patch they all lay nearly three hundred years of lives not a life among them easy or unafflicted A sum of so much of the valley could be found in them and a sum which would keep emerging in me for however long I lived Now Bessie Ringer in her way the most sorrowing to see vanish because she had been the most durable of them all Wonder built in me as I traced out her last day The morning Grandma had spent working on a quilt another of her rainbowpaneled splendors for a helpful neighbor who looked in on her often Sometime she had telephoned to a friend at a ranch out of Ringling asking to be brought a fresh supply of eggs when the woman came to town At noon she was phoned by her son and as usual in those checking calls they talked for several minutes In the afternoon a funeral was held for a member of one of the last families of the Sixteen country Grandma did not go to the rites but at the coffee hour held afterward at the Senior Citizens Club she helped with the serving and chatted with friends for an hour or more Someone had driven her home where she had her supper alone In the evening there was to be the weekly card party back at the Senior Citizens Club and she phoned to ask for a ride with her best friend in the woman who had run one of the White Sulphur saloons that had so often thorned Grandmas Doig405 earlier life They had nearly arrived at the card party when in the midst of something joked by one or the other of them Grandma cut off in the middle of a chuckle and slumped chin onto chest The friend whirled the car to the hospital a block away A doctor instantly was trying to thump a heartbeatrhythm into Grandma and could work no flicker of response from her She had gone from life precisely as she had lived it with abruptness and at full pace Once more the funeral the Bible rhythms the lines of faces brigading back out of the chapel into the past The relatives had raised their eyebrows when I told them the one funeral request Grandma had ever made to me I want a closed casket Makes me spooky to think of every body gawping down at me like that I flinched in turn when the ministers reading from Ecclesiastes began flatly The sun rises and the sun goes down then it presses on I had forgotten to specify the King James language to him Then the wryness came to me Why had I expected my gran Q mothers exit to be any less touched by contention than her life had been At the graveside at last in the cold weather the rites had to be hurried through the casket rapidly roped down from sight condolences quickly spoken in smoking breaths and as quickly taken by me Carols arm in mine made the single spot of warmth in the last of the cold minutes As the groups of us began to turn toward our cars the valleys mountainchilled wind skirled hard among us I recognized it from the afternoon of my fathers burial 0 Doig 407 This set of sagas memory Over and over selftold as if the mind must have a way to pass its time docket all the promptings for itself within its narrow bone cave A final prism of remembering the February afternoon at a northern Pacific coastline Carol and I with a pair of friends hiking beside the exploding surf Gray restless weather my favorite mood of the firshagged wild shore In a dozen journeys here Carol and I repeat to each other never have we seen the waves break so high and far After a short mile at Ellen Creek the four of us pause The creeks meek flow has boiled wide swirly as the ocean surf drums into the mouth of the channel and looses giant whorls of tide up the start of the stream John ever the boldest of us explores a route inland across a log to the coiling creekbank opposite and there brushwhacking his way atop other logs and debris until he at last drops safely back to the ocean beach I am uneasy thinking through the chances of one of us snapping a leg in the debris or slipping the drop into the creek The Ellen is a known channel that Carol and I have crossed and retcrossed casually all the times before With the storm surf nosing at it as it is the stream may have risen now to thighhigh but still a waders depth I suggest that I go across upstream of the surf line find the shallowest route for Carol and Jean to come after they agree Boots slung Doig 408 around my neck I slog rapidly into the water At the deepest part the water surprises me for an instant by lapping up just over my belt then as I begin the last dozen pulling strides to a vast slosh of tide swells across the top of my chest and undertow lifts away my feet Like a bug down a drain I am sucked feet first into the ocean gravel beating up at me like shrapnel as the surf plows its roaring way shore and sky and all else lost in the water avalanche After forever I am reversed surged back to the tideline slammed down then rolled to sea again Now I paddle to stay upright and simply am turned and turned toyfJike within the next acres of water until I am struck against the shore again Taken out into the froth yet again this time I try to ride the surf with my body eagling my arms wide again I am pitched over and over hurled to gravel instantly lifted away and out How many times this repeats there is no as few and as many as five Even as my body is being beaten limp my mind finds incredible clarity as if the thinking portion of me had been lifted separately and set aside from the oceans attack While my arms and legs automatically try trick after trick to pull me atop the water and onto the precipice of shore the feeling of death settles into me bringing both surprise at the ease and calm of the process and a certain embarrassed chiding of myself that this is a silly and early method to exit from r Doig409 life John later told that as I came whirling out of the surf one more time he saw on my face a look of deep resignation My remembering of that instant is of noting him mouth open in a shout I cannot hear beginning to run from forty yards away and then in my next writhe within the dense falling wall of surf discovering his arm across my back and under me dragging my weary threepointed stumble from the undertow At the shallow moving seam of shore and surf John exults in my ear Weve got it made now But I sense as if a monstrous paw poised just beyond the edge of my vision the next set of waves toppling toward us we both are struck flat but somehow hold the shore Only then in the wash back to sea of that aftermost wave do my boots finally float free from around my neck and John reaches casually as they pass and plucks them from the last of the water Now Carol and Jean at our sides flung to us through the flooding creek by their desperation and the luck of an interval between tidal whirlpools their hands and Johns steadying me until at last up off the cold bite of the shore gravel I stand again That forenoon a few dozen months into the past has stayed much in my mind and not only for the marvel of finding myself undrowned and for the gratitude of having had three lives offered up instantly for mine By the time of that incident this book already had begun to over my fingers J Doig410 and my scuff against death inevitably called up in me the endings put to other figures in my family with less reason than my mistaken wade into tbsEllen Spaced where I am past having been young but not quite yet the odd of still loom quite far from my usual thoights Yet this much has been brought hometo me fully that added now into the lineage of all else I share with Charlie and Bessie Ringer is the sensation of having 3Wi r le d been st lf r or deepest hazard The links are made instantly J emo y spun spun within the fro thing wave rocn to Surf glavel beats up a the black gelding the cattle me like shrapnel the hooves of across Dad in the corral dirt I feel in my musing on it as if the two of them too somehow stood up out of the slosh of death with me the one giving his cocked grin of wryness at having survived one time more the other muttering at the receding ocean and marching us all off into dry clothes Then my father and my grandmother go together back elsewhere in memory and I am left to think through the fortune of all we experienced together And of how nowmy single outline meets the air that knew theirs I
