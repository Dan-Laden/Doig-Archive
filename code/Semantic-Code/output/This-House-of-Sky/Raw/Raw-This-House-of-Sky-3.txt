 Doig89 FLIP me call her Ruth here She came to the ranch on one of the first pale chilly days of an autumn hired to cook for us for a few monthscnd J stayed on in our lives for almost three years Her time with us is a strange season all mist and dusk and halfseen silhouettes halfheard cries There is nothing else like it in the sortings of my memory Nor is there anything now to be learned about why it happened to be her who became my fathers second wife and my second mother for no trace Doig90 of Ruthrreminiscence written line photograph keepsakek has survived It is as if my father tried to scour every sign of her from our lives But not even scouring can get at the deepest crevices of memory and in them I glimpse Ruth again I see best the eyes large and softly brown with what seemed to be some hurt beginning to happen behind themMthe deep trapped look of a doe the instant before she breaks for cover The face was too oval plain as a small white platter but those madonna eyes graced it DarkhairedLr think brunette slim but full taller than my mother had been nearly as tall as Dad A voice with the grit of experience in it and a knowing laugh twice as old as herself Not quite entirely pretty this taut guarded Ruth 11 but close enough to earn second looks And the mystery in her could not be missed the feeling that being around her somehow was like watching the roulette wheel in the Maverick make its slow fan like ambush on chance Even how Ruth came to be there straight in our path after Dad turned our lives toward the valley seems to have no logic to it Never before or since did I see A like her on a ranch Ranch cooks generally were stout spinsters or leathery widows worn dour and curt by a life which gave them only the chore of putting meals on the table Doig 91 for a dozen hungry men three times a day So alike were cooks usually that the hired men seldom bothered t0 learn their names simply called each one Missus4fBut Ruth didnt fit Missus she was Ruth to everybody Those eyes were the kind which caught your glance on the streets of Great Falls or Helena where young women went to escape to a store job and the start toward marriage and a life they hoped would be bigger thanthe hometown had offered city eyes restless M eyes Yet here Ruth was in the valley passing the syrup pitcher along and for all anyone could tell she seemed ready to stay until she came upon whatever she was looking for Her first reach had been badly out of marriage quickly broken to a young soldier He was home on a furlough one time a voice from his family tells it and met her and married her in such short time really they werent even acquainted Dad must have known about that jagged tooquick marriage the valley kept no such secrets But living womanless had left us wide open for Ruth To me an eight yearold she was someone who might provide some mothering again Not much mothering because she kept a tight careful mood like a cat ghosting through new tall grass But the purr of a soft voice fresh cookies and fruit added to my lunchbox even a rare open grin from her when I found an Doig 92 excuse to loiter in the were pettings I hadnt had And for Dad Ruth must have come as a sudden chance to block the past a woman to put between him and the death on the summer mountain It happened faster than any of us could follow This man who had spent six careful years courting my mother now abruptly married his young ranch cook Ruth Dad They were a pairing only the loins could have tugged together and as with many decisions taken between the thighs all too soon there were bitterest afterthoughts All toG LIledrumf re of egret and retaiiatio echoeI remember that began to echo them before we moved from the ranch in early 1948 only months after the wedding The ranch itself had plenty of ways to nick away at everyones nerves Any sprinkle of rain or 0 snow puttied its road into a trnug o the pickup wallowing and whipping as Dad cussed his way back and forth Yet the place also was too dry for good hay or grain and too scabbed with rock up on the slopes where the cattle and sheep had to graze Dad had begun to call it thisgoddamnrockpile the surest sign that he was talking himself into dropping the lease For her part Ruth likely was ready to leave after the first night of howling coyotes or of a cougar Doig 93 edging out of the Castles to scream down a gulch Working as a cook on the big ranches out in the open expanse of the valley was one thing but slogging away here under the tumbled foothills was entirely another Her mouth could fire words those soft eyes seemed to know nothing about and the ranch primed her often I can hear her across the years Charlie I dont have to stay here I didnt marry this hellforsaken ranch I got other places I can go dont you doubt it Lots of places Charlie And Dad the jut notching out his jaw as it always did when he came ready for argument Damn it woman dye think we can walk away from a herd of cattle and a band of sheep We got to stay until we get the livestock disposed You And always the last q knew what you were getting into as he would hurl from the house out to another of the ranchs endless chores Just orgetit But nothing was forgotten by either of them Instead they stored matters up against one another The time that you I told you then There came to be a full litany of combat and either one would refer as far back as could be If they remembered sfeaJ had fought a cehe the marriage might have snapped apart before long and neither would have been severely hurt But they bickered in quick seasons Weeks Yvl maybe a month in calm Saturday nights we Doig 94 went to dances in the little town of Ringling Dad and Ruth whirled there by the hour often my Uncle Angus called the square dances and I would watch Dad in a circle of flying dancers while a burring voice so close to his cried Swing your opposite across the hall now swinq vour corners now your partners and Promenade all Sometime after midnight I would stretch on a bench along the dancehall wall with a coat over me and go to sleep I would wake up leaning against Ruths shoulder as the pickup growled down the low hill to the ranch buildings The murmurs I heard then between Dad and Ruth would go on for a day or two But eventually a blast of argument then no talking sulking Sometimes Ruth would leave for a day or two Sometimes Dad told her to leave and she wouldnt At last one or the other would make a truce never by apology just some softened oblique sentence 11 which meant that the argument could be dropped now Until Ruth felt restless again until Dads unease twisted in him once more I watched this slow bleed of a marriage not yet old enough to be afraid of exactly what might happen but with the feeling creeping in me that the arguments in our house meant more than I could see Joking with me as she sometimes did Ruth would grin and her face come down close to mine If your hair gets any redder youre gonna set the town on fire you know that Dad talked in his usual soft burr when I rode in the pickup with him Son lets go fix that Doig 95 fence where Rankins cows got in Theres not enough grass on this elace for our own without that honyockers cows in here too Hold on Im gonna give her snoose to get up this they were together I A sidehill But when heard a hard edge in what they said to each other a careful evenness as they talked over plans to leave the ranch as soon they could For what was happening I can grasp now was the judgment greater by far than their decision to be married their mutual refusal to call it off that logical retreat Dad would not because he wanted not to look a fool Each had a fear blockading admit ee his mis take to the valley 1 e was entirely wrong the only mystification anyone seemed to have was why he kept on with a hopeless mismatch I couldnt see that going on with that with that little child you in the midst of it a woman of the valley once cried to me Ruth thou2ht everything should come in a cloud for her But she had hate in her she was full of hatefulness What was Charlie of to let that go on For her part Ruth would not face up to another split would not let another broken marriage point to her as an impossible wife Since neither could see how to call a halt to the mismarriage it somehow was going to have to halt itself But before it did the pair of them would make two mighty exertions to stay together Doig 96 Perhaps because this arrival of Ruth in our lives is a riff le of time which everyone around me later tried to put from mind memory hovers stubbornly here memory or the curious nature perhaps that keeps asking exactly what the ri commotion was about For on tire edge of this fray between Dad and Ruth I begin to see myself and here at the age of eight and nine and ten I was curiosity itself If I i nscribe myself freehand as Dad did with the unfading stories he told me of his own young years the words might be these I was a boy I would scarcely know on the street today Chunky redhaired freckled1 the plump face straight off a jar of strawberry jam Always wearing a small cowboy hat because I seared in the sun Under that hat and inside a name like no one elses Ivan EYEvun amid the Frankie RonnyBobbyJirnrnyLarrYHowie trill of my schoolmates Dad was amazed with himself when he at last discovered that he had spliced Russian onto the Scottish family name he and my mother simply had known someone named Ivan and liked the sudden soft curl of the wordkand besides wanted to show up Dads least favorite brother YJunio onto a son4t The name freckles gave me I wasnt always sure I wanted At Dads side in the saloons I sometimes met men who would look down at me and sing out WNow the heroes were J2lenty and well known to fameWho fought in the ranks of the CzarBut Doig 97 the bravest of all was by the nameOf Skavar W I consoled myself that it was better dubbed Red or Pinky which I also heard sometimes in the saloons And once in a great while in his thoughtful mood as if remembering a matter away Dad would call me YskavinskyY It made a special moment and I prized it that way People who remember me at this age say I was something of a small sentinel ou always were such a little sobersides You was always so damned bashful it was hard to get a word out of youVJ All right but how jolly was I supposed to be with a mother dead and the next one in a sniping match with my father I believe that much of what was taken to be my soberness was simply a feeling of being on guard of carefully watching life flame around me Of trying not to be sur rised at whatever else I can tell ou a time as my father so many of his into me Dad and Ruth and I are walking toward the movie house on some night of truce in the family We are at the end of the block from the buildincr when I notice Kirkwoodcoming down the street Kirkwood is a school classmate but a forehead taller than I am and with that head round as a cannonball and atop sguare shoulders you could lay bricks on Kirkwood can never be counted on to behave the same from one minute to the next and now he bears down on us lelps Hullo Doig 98 Ivy and takes a swipe at my hat4The worst prospect I can think of is corning true the great riven of bothood is not to make you look silly in front of and Kirkwood is toedancing all over it Now he has put on a hyena grin and falls in step with me He glances toward Dad and Ruth then skips at me and knocks the hat from my head llrnurderyouv I rasp as lethally as I can and clap the hat down over my ears It sends his delirium up another notch and he skips in for another whack at the hat Dad and Ruth no longer can pretend not to notice and begin to glance back at the sniggering and rnutterin9 behind them Kirkwood giggles this time when I hear him scuffling close I swing around with my right arm stiff in what I now understand was a riJht jab Kirkwood runs his round jaw into it and bounces flat onto the sidewalk He wobbles up looks at me dazedly then trots off in a steady howl I hustle toward the movie house where Dad and Ruth are waiting and watching Both are grinninr as if they have mouths full of marshmallows But I was less sure of my feelings It was as if I had been through a dream that I knew was going happen Not in every detailMwho could foresee even Kirkwood gone that in its conclusion that from the instant Kirkwood rambled into sight he was aimed onto my fist It somehow seemed to me there ought to be an Doig 99 about such certainty some questioning of why it had to be inexorably so But it was a guestioning I could not handle and what I felt most was the curious intensity of having seen it all unfold myself somehow the scene as it swept past me Somehow a pair of me the one doing and the one seeifB it done It was exactly that twinned mixbapprehension and interestedness that I felt all during Ruths startling time in our lives Now the awaited move when we at last would put the ranch and its zone of combat behind us Put them behind us in fact in a way as wondrous to me as it was unexpected for Dad and Ruth faced toward White Sulphur Springs and undertook the last livelihood anyone could have predicted of either of them they went into the cafe business The Grill across the street from the Stockman had come up for rent It was the third and smallest eating place in a town which had not quite was the barest smidgin of reason to think of Ruth such an enterprise with her years of cooking for crews she at least could handle a kitchen But for Dad the notion had all the logic of a bosuns mate stumping ashore to open up a candy shop Yet somehow Dad and Ruth this pair who had never been around a town business of any sort and who already were finding out that they flinted sparks off one Doig 100 to have a knack for it The knack of course was ninetenths hard work Those two took on that place like a house afire But when Dad sorted through his savvy there was use there too 0 uro enough about all the ranches behind him he knew and better yet he knew the valley and its people He put up new hours for the Grill Xt would stay open until after the last saloon had closed There at the last of the night and the first hours of morning the Grill found its customers truckers on their 1M runs through the pitchy dark ranchers heading home from late business in Helena or Great Falls some of the Rainbow crowd trying to sober up on black coffee and Tbone Steaks and hashbrowns covered Ruths stove and Dad dealt platters of food until his arms ached Saturday nights I was stay up as late as I wantedon Dads principle of fathering M that I might as well have a look at life sooner than laterJand I looked forward to the pace of that last night of the week like a long long parade coming past Just at dusk ranch hands would begin to troop in for supper minutesold haircuts shining between their shirt collars and hat brims because Well I go in and get my ears lowered was the standard excuse to come to town for Doig101 a night of carousing As the dark eased down and the from the crowds in the Maverick and the Grand Central came oftener the cafe would begin to receive the staggerers who had decided to forget the haircut after all and get right on with the drinking They were a pie crowd usually jabbing blearily at the fluffiest and most meringueheaped possibilities Sometime in midevening Lloyd would arrive suspiciously fingering down a coin for a cup of coffee and demanding to know if my freckles werent from a cows tail having swiped across me Soon after him as if the towns two prime bellies couldnt be long apart it would be Nellie crashing in chortling with delight and spinning a joke off the first item he spotted That jam jar nowcsdid you hear about the Swede at the breakfast table tYimineyY he says I yoost learn to call it yam and now they tell me its yelly then if there was a dance in the hall behind the Rainbow the night would crest with two tides of customers one which filled the cafe as soon as the dance ended and a second made up of those who had gone off to drink some more until the first wave cleared out And at last sometime after two in the morning would come the phone call from Pete McCabe thirty yards across at the Stockman Save us three Charlie Dad would put aside a trio of Tbone steaks and before long Pete and his nights pair of bar help would be straddling in to the counter Doig 102 and trading the nights news with Dad A few hours before Sunday dawn the Grill would close and we would step out the door into the emptied town A quieter flow of eaters presented themselves too I was to towns oldtimers the pensioners the sheepherders and cowpokes hanging on from yesteryear As I have told the Stockman where Pete McCabe was known to be the kind of a fellow who would set up a drink even when the pension check hadnt yet come to pay for it drew most of these oldtimers sometime in the night sometime through the week Now over across the street Dad was good for an emergency meal as well How many times I heard one or another of them joking so as not to seem begging ask Dad for a meal on account that was of being broke Weeks and months and even years afterward one or another of them might stop him on the street and say Charlie heres that Grill money Ive been owing you Ruth I think never objected to those meals Dad would jot onthe tab They might fight over a spilled holder of toothpicks but not that long apologetic rank of accountants Out on the valley ranches she had seen in the crews clopping to her supper table the men who were growing too old for the work they had done all their lives and soon too old for anything but those lame rounds of the saloons along Main Street Age was making that same wintry push on the one Doig 103 person Ruth seemed steadily to hold affection for too She had been raised by her grandmotherJher family so poor M and at war with itself it had shunted her off thereland H regularly she went across the Big Belts to the next valley to see the old woman Several times on an afternoon off from the cafe she took me on those visits Creased and heavy stiff in the knees and going blind the grandmother was the most ancient woman I had ever seen and her house the shadowiest and most silent The grandmother spent her days entirelyvn the dim kitchen finding her way by habit through a thickening haze of cataract webs When we stepped in past the black kitchen stove and the drab cabinets lining the walls the grandmother would peer toward us and then begin to talk in a resigned murmur eyes and legs giving way above and below a body not yet quite willing to die and Ruth listening would be a different person softer younger seeming to feel the grandmothers aches as her own But whatever Ruth took from those visits seemed to stop at our own doorsill Time and again she and Dad faced off and then they would go full of silence for a day or more Or worse one would be silent and the other would claw on and onfrf nothing else set them at each other there always was the argument about our small herd of cattle which Dad had kept after all when we left the ranch and which he was pasturing now in the foothills of the Big Belts Doig104 He drove out each morning to pitch hay to the cattle then came back to work in the cafe from midafternoon until closing On weekends I went with him to the cattle and only then would hear out of him the few tiny snatches of music he knew his absen f1ninded sign of contentment A forkful of alfalfa cows then But the squaws along the J I I a tuneless minute of whistling and looking out across the valley to the pinnacles of the Castles then When its springtime in the Rockies Whether or not Ruth knew he was out there singing and whistling amid the cows she did suspect that Dad had not given up intentions of ranching Dad suspected just as rightly that neither of them could keep up the dayandnight pace of the cafe work for long and that our income soon was going to have to come from livestock again In the meantime we had become town people and I had the time to myself to roam White Sulphur Once in one of the tributes I would get used to in the valley someone beside Dad in a saloon caught me studying up at him and blurted That kid is smarter than he knows what to do with Which was right enough and yet I did know enough to keep my eyes moving through the town reading whatever of it showed itself The rememberings from that have lasted as a kind of casing which goes into place over the earlier odyssey with Dad through the saloons a second and wider Doig lOS circle across undefined territory and this time on my own The plainest fact I found so plain that it seemed to me then itfOuldpeverJchange was that White Sulphur totally lived on livestock All the places I liked best had the sounds and smells and feels which came one way or another from the herds and flocks out on the leathered slopes of grassland In the creamery where Dad bought milk and butter for the cafe the air hung so heavy with the dampness of processing that it was like walking against pillows and everyone talked loudly out of the sides of their mouths to be heard over the rumble of churns Nearby the grain elevator took a noise like that and tripled it the roaring clank of conveyors carrying off wheat and barley and oats somewhere into the high box of tower At the railroad shipping pens the noises came directly from the livestock In their best of times sheep go through life in a nearpanic and their frenzied bleating as they were wrangled up the chutes into boxcars grew to a storm of sound And the cattle when they were pastured near the pens a day or so before shipping could be heard all across towna constant choir of moaning M like wind haunting into ten thousand chimneys at once White Sulphur was as unlovely but interesting as the sounds of its livelihood A teacher who had arrived just then to his first classroom job would town didnt look too perky It had been through Depression Doig106 and a world war and obviously nobody had built anything or painted anything or cleaned anything for twenty years 1J Sited where the northern edge of the valley began to rumple mineral water bubbling there had stretched tself awkwardly along the design of a very wide T Main Street the top of the T ran east and west with most of the towns houses banked up the low hills on either side of the business area at its eastern end To the west lay the sulphur slough the railroad and shipping pens and the creamery and grain elevator The highway in its run up the valley snapped in there like the leg of the T onto Main Street Much of the countryside traffic then was aimed to this west end of town while all the saloons and grocery stores and cafesJM and the post off ice and the druggist and the doctor and the two lawyers since it took two to fight out a court case1M did business at the east end This gave White Sulphur an odd strungout pattern of life as if the parts of the community had been pinned along a clothesline But it also meant there was an openness to the town plenty of space to see on to the next thing which might interest yoiilJuil to FOaiii lserStYA Even the school helped with this senslf curiosity because it had been built T where two of the towns main 11 Doig107 attractions for a boy also had ended upthe county jail M and the sulphur slough Since the nine saloons downtown fueled a steady traffic of drunks the jail was kept busy and most schooldays we had a fine clear view of the ritual there It was only a few dozen yards from the diamond where we played workUp softball to where the brick jail building perched atop a small embankment clust in from the edge of this embankment a wire clothesline had been looped two fat posts Right there the recess at thesame time as ours They were sent out to pin their bedding on the clothesline and beat some cleanliness into i t1and I suppose to huff M some of the alcohol out of themselves Sheepherders who had come in from the mountains for their annual binge the regular winos from the Grand who were tossed in jail every few months to dry out once in a while a skinny scuffedup cowboy from one of the Rankin rancheslthere they would be fl ll Qt nights downtown on the embankment before us like performers on a stage Most of the men I could recognize from my with Dad But one morning a single inmate came out a slender man I didnt know but whose face I seemed to have seen before The softball game stopped as we all puzzled at that strange familiar face The instant before any of us figured it out one of my classmates rushed to get his words into the air first Hey thats my dad His the replica of Doig 108 time hesaid we the air toward the next batter It I around At the bottom of the slope from the school grounds as if it had seeped down from the overflow off the prisoners bedding lay the sulphur slough which gave White Sulphur its name On cold days the slough steamed and steamed thin fog puffs wisping up from the reeds as if this was where the entire valley breathed Any weather the water stewed out an odor like rotten eggs At the slough edge nearest the school stood a tiny gazebo a rickety scrap from the towns days when it had tried to be a resort Either as decoration or a roof against bird droppings the gazebo sheltered a small hot spring A corroding cup hung on one pillar of the gazebo and if you dared to touch it then you could dare the taste of the sulphur spring water One of my classmatesLot course Kirkwood downed the Ill V water as if it were free lemonade His grandfather a nastyfaced character who indeed gave every sign that he might live forever had convinced him that the stuff was for a persons insides After Kirkwood had slurped down a cupful I would reluctantly sip away What bothered me even worse than the taste was the rancid look of the spring The sulphur water had layered its minerals into a kind of putty on stones and clay and even the underwater Doig109 strands of grass and the spring always was coated with this sickly whitish curd as if something poisonous had just died there And yet nowhere else had anything like this steaming place and so the slough and its ugly water drew us l hi te Sulphur had other lures I thought must be the only ones of their kind in the universe the giant carcasses M of buildings to be poked into Late in the last century when the town had figured it might grow a few grandiose buildings had been put up and they had not yet fallen down entirely Near the sulphur slough stood the remains of the Springs Hotel a long box of and verandas which had been built for resortoers who came to take the waters I seem to remember that whatever was left of this building was so treapherous none of us would go out on its floor more than a few feet from the wall you could fall through the sagging floorboards to some black awfulness below Another awfulness clung to the Springs Hotels past The story was that someone had been killed diving into its swirnming pool that White Sulphur dwindled away from being a resort after that The public death of that diver was epitaphed in the hotels blind gape of windows and the broken spine of ridgepole A boy stepped uneasily here and stepped away not quite knowing what it was that brought him back and back Across town loomed a huger wreck cheerier and much more inviting This one was called the Old Audi toriuma sharp Doig 110 comedown from its original name the Temple of had been built in the 1890s by an earnest group of local magazine writer who happened through town 1 described the type as exerting every nerve to prosoerMwho totally misjudged the towns need for a structure of that size Probably there never had been enough people in the entire county to fill the place even if all had been herded in at gunpoint for cultures sakecrfpuilt of brick with a shingled dome rising from the middle of the roof like a howdah on the back of a great red elephant and a forest of chimneys teetering unevenly around the edge the temple had never been finished by its exhausted backers although it was complete enough to use for school recitals and graduation ceremonies by the time the 1925 earthquake shook it onto the condemned list A dozing dinosaur of a building it had been collapsing little by little ever since the earthquake Now the remains stood over us roofless ghost ike magical as a wizards abandoned castle I think it must have been not only the size and gape of the place but the glacial spill of tr acted brickyard Temple of own and a number of besides the Fun had been put come through the years into a clapboard appearance which made brickbuilt respectability seem very rareand Doig 111 here was the largest stack of the reddest brick I could imagine I could prowl and doors had vanished long amid the clattering emptiness walk the old stage study out from the dilapidated walls where rooms had been Echoes flew back to me as if the auditorium had stored all the sounds from its prime years It stood as a kind of cavern of history could go off into an expanse for a few of us a place where you of both space and time One other large brick building graced White Sulphur and if the old auditorium was a cave to be sought out this next was a manmade mass you could not avoid You came to itlthe I Sherman you walked up Main Street three massive stories of brick and cornicework snouting out into the thoroughfare as firmly as a thumb crimping into a hose Jf At the very start of White Sulphurs history there had been a dispute about where Main Street ought to run The doctor who held the land at the west end of town banked too heavily on the notion that some judicious slough drainage and timber roa bedding would draw the route along his holdings A rival laid out a plat to the east of him complete with a 25foot jog away from the direction of the slough and directly out into the path mapped out for Main Street In some wink of confusion or bribery the rival survey was accepted by the authorities the town grew up along the misjointed plat lines and for the next sixty years the big brick hotel built at the boundary of I Doig 112 the muddle squatted halfway into Main the hotel lobby a wide high window had been installed near the outer edge of this prowz ike jut to take advantage of the outlook Sitting there in a leather chair you could watch the cars come straight as fence wire until suddenly they had to angle off Old men hobbled into the hotel to the afternoon hours away and watch the cars do their surprised swerve around them It made a pastime and the town didnt have many For some reason I cant summon back once in those years Dad and I checked into the Sherman Hotel for a night The room was worse than we had expected and worse even than the hotels rundown reputation A bare a battered bed I think there was not even a nightstand or chair The bedsprings howled with rust Sometime in the skreeking night Dad said Call this rattletrap a hotel do they Ive slept better in wet sagebrush4J And as it was the cumbersome hotel did some duty for the town The teacher arriving to his job stepped from the bus there and went in to ask the clerk if there were lockers for his baggage for a day or two Just throw it there in the corner he was told But Id liketo lock it away everything I ownis in there The clerk looked at him squarely for the first time Just throw it in the corner there I said When the teacher came back in a day or so all was in the corner untouched Doig113 One last landmark from those years the gray stone house called The Castle It speared up from the top of the hill behind the Stockman a granite presence which seemed to have loomed there before the rest of the town was ever dreamed of Actually a man named Sherman had built it in the early 1890s with bonanza money from a silver lode in the Castle Mountains He had the granite blocks cut and sledded in by ox team from the mountains and from a little distance the threestory mansion with its round tower and sharp roof peaks looked like one of the sets of fantasy pinnacles which poke up all through that range So in name and material and appearance all three old Sherman built for himself an eerie likeness of the Castles which had yielded up his fortune If the outside was a remindful whim the inside of the Castle showed Shermans new money doing some prancing It was said he had spared nothing in expensewoodwork crafted ffi of hardwoods from distant countries crystal dangles on every chandelier a huge water tank in the attic which sluiced water down to fill the bathtubs in an instant a furnace which burned hard hot anthracite coal shipped all the way from Pennsylvania All this was known only by rumor as I would circle past because Sherman had been in his grave for twenty years and the Castle now stood with boards across its windows and swallows mud nests clotted onto the fancy stonework Those were the relic faces of White Sulphur the fading profiles of what the presented themselves Doig 114 town had set out to be Other features 11e too off the faces of the A thousand people who lived in White Sulphur then and a second thousand dotted out on the ranches from one far end of the county to another Of all those twenty hundred living faces the one clearest bit since has been our madmans What had torn apart Hendriks brailnAdefect of birth some stab of illness or accident1r have never known But IV he hung everlastingly there at the edge of town life gaping and leering His parents old and made older by the calamity which had ripped their sons mind would bring Hendrik to town with them when they came for groceries Slouched in their pickup or against the corner of the grocery Hendrik grimaced out at us like a tethered dog whose mood a person could never be entirely sure of 41He was able to recognize friends of the family such as Dad and make childs talk to themJinnocent words growled out of a strongmans body And ll somewhere in odds and ends of his mind he had come up G with th to draw people to him He would gargle out loudly what could have orKthreat YOU god uh CIGuhREDDflNo one would de this pitiful spectre a cigarette and Hendrik would puff away with a twisted squint of satisfaction his eyes already glowering along the street for his next donor Dad who was uneasy around any affliction but was fond of Hendriks family always lit the cigarette carefully and said a few words while I peeked up at the rough man Doig 115 If he happened to look down at me it was like being watched by the hot eye of a hawk All through this time I can pick out again and again that scene of poor clever lunatic Hendrik and a town uneasy under his glare In that time I puzzled up into three other faces which were strange to melthe black faces of Rose Gordon Taylor M Gordon and Bob Gordon The Gordons I know now were one of the earliest and most diligent families of White Sulphur The parents of Rose and Taylor and Bob had come in during the towns short heyday of mining wealth and Mother Gordon had become the towns laundress Mammas looked like a schooner comin in But to me the three Gordons could have been newly set down from the farthest end of the world where people were the color of night They were very blackiRose in particular had a sheen dark as ink Their M faces were unlined not crinkled at the corners of the eyes as Dads and the other ranch mens were And their voices chimed amid the burrs and twangs of everyone else downtown Taylor Gordon was a singer Every so often he would perform at the high school auditorium singing the spirituals he had heard from his mother as she worked at her wash tubs His tenor voice could ripple like muscle hold like a hawser across the notes Swiiing low sweet chaaaariot The strong sweet sound had carried him to New where he sang in concert halls and on the radio and had been declared Doig116 by a national magazine asthe latest rival to Paul RobesonY He also had gone through money as if he were tossing confetti into the streets of Harlem and when the Depression hit he promptly ended up back in the valley herding he brought with him New York stories such as no one in the valley had ever heard or dreamed of Of his writer friend Carl Van Vechten He was a big Dutchman he had very buck teeth rabbit teeth like and weighed about two hundred pounds lets say and was six feet tall But he wasnt what the called a potbellied six He liked sometimes to wear a phantom red shirt reddest red I ever saw He wore rings know exotic rings something that would stand out or a bracelet somethin like that Bein a millionaire he could do those things I remember one night we went to a partJ Carl and I was dressed as in Harlem dressed in kind of satire Some man gave both of us sam hill He said You got somethin to offer the world You dont have to do an thing out of the ordinar just Carl laughed and said Well cant we have a little FUN Of a black man he said had a magic with words and deeds When everibody was broke a lot of people would go to Father Divine and get the best meal in the world for cents see

could tell where hed been in a fight If you were shootin you more or less would be bendin down when you got cut and that way youd get it across the forehead here Whereas if you were elayin eoker you

he was from Geechyland if he was cut this other way he was from Selma Alabama and so on and so on Now either Taylor or Bob owned the building the post office was in and the pair of them lived on the second floor Taylor came and went in a bold erect style always with some new plan for singing in New York again or making a fortune from some gadget he had invented He also took pride in being the one writing man the valley had ever had Taylor as a talented storytellerfvit was as if his voice put a rich gloss on anything it while he had been in New York singing at society parties writers such as Van Vechten wfeurged him to make a manuscript of his stories of earlyday White Sulphur They steered him to a publisher and illustrator and shepherded Doig 118 his guesswork grammar into print as a memoir with the title Born to Be4The book with his name on it naturally impressed Taylor into thinking he could do another This time there was no help and no publisher The failure mast hsJa worked on his mind for years eventually he saw conspirators The man who published his first book had become John Steinbecks publisher as well and for the rest of his life Taylor told anyone who would listen that Steinbeck and the publisher had pirated his second book idea and made it into The Grapes While Taylor built that phantom swindle in his mind of Wrath Bob Gordon crashed back and forth between street and room a desperate drinker even by White Sulphur standards I would see him sometimes when I went to the post off ice for the mail off somewhere in his plodding stagger I remember that he wore suspenders one of the few men in town who did and the straps made a slumping X across his big back as they slid down his shoulders Brothers indeed Taylor and Bob in desperation as well as in skin the one daydreaming of New York and second fame the other fumbling for his next bottle of whiskey Rose Gordon lived apart from her brothers both in place and behavior She was the one in the family who had chosen to be courtly toward the white faces all around and a time or two a week she came along Main Street a plump dark fluff Doig119 of a woman with her constant greeting How do you do And how are you today Rose had extreme faith in words and manners The death of any oldtimer would bring out her pen and a long letter to the Meagher County News extolling the departed She the was especially fond of two groups in the valleys arocJ Scots who had homesteaded in the Basin and the valley and the Indians who had worn away before the of settlement Her passion for the Indians fellow sufferers for the dusk of their skin was understandable enough The were the first ladies of this land she would declare of the Indian women she had seen when she was a girl and the saying of it announced that Rose Gordon knew ladyship from personal experience But the transplanted Scots my fathers family and the others who had never seen black faces before and in all likelihood didnt care for them when they did It their talk The lowlands burr the throaty words which came out their mouths like low song captivated RosecJlshe wasas entranced with the spoken word as Taylor was with the written and the oration she had given when she was valedictorian of her high school class oration given A I from a rostrum in the old auditorium a large American flag fastened square and true along the back stage wa11Jhad been the summit of her life When I had become a grown man she astonished me once by reciting the climax of Doig 120 that oration sixty years before I gave my address on the progress of the Negro race I ended I said The colored soldiers have earned the highest courage and they won unstinted praises by their bravery loyalty and fidelity They have indeed been baptized into full citizenship by their bloodshed in defense of their country and they have earned the protection ti of that honorable emblem the Stars and Stripes While Rose held those words in her memory as if they were her only heirloomotherstreet voices plaided White Sulphur life for me as well The twang which gritted out of Lloyd Robinson and the other Missourians You could of talked all day long and not said that Seen

threw my hat in the door first It didnt come back out so I figured I was safe And always always the two voices which went at each other just above my head Ruth where the hell XU been If you think you can just walk off and leave me with the cafe that way you got another think corning Mister I didnt marry you to spend all my time in any damn cafe Where I go is my business The look in my direction then Better leave us alone Ivan But the voices would go on through the walls until one more silence set in between my father and my second mother The silences stretched tauter until a day sometime in the autumn of 1948 when the Grill and our town life came to an end Dad and Ruth could agree on one thing the tremendous hours of cafe work were grinding them down They gave up the lease and now bought a thousand head of sheep and arranged to winter them at a ranch on Battle Creek in the Sixteen country not far from the Basin where Dad had grown upttThere seemed to be no middle ground in the rnarriageYnot having managed EJ to make it work while under the stare of the entire town Doig122 now the two of them decided to try a winter truce out in what was the emptiest corner of the when Peter and Annie Doig came county just as it had there to homestead d as it A is whenever I return now to drive its narrow redShale road QfJScaraAh Out there in the rimming hills beyond the valley 25 miles from town Dad and Ruth would have time alone to see whether their marriage ought to last Could last And I began what would be a theme of my life staying in town in the living arrangement we called boarding out It meant that someone or other friend or relative or simply looked reliable would be paid by Dad to provide me roomandboard during the weekdays of school It reminds me now of a long visit the inbetween feeling of having the freedom to wander in and out but never quite garnering any space of your own But I had some knack then for living at the edges of other peoples existences and in this first span of boarding friends of Ruth the Jordan familytiI found a household its comingsandgoings almost as the cafe the house I around here Helen Jordan said as deer season opened and a surge of her outoftown relatives armed like a guerrilla platoon swept through Ralph Jordan himself came and went at uneven hours of the day and night black with coal dust and so weary he could hardly talk he was fireman on the Doig 123 belching old locomotive called Sagebrush Annie which snailed down the branchline from White Sulphur to the main railroad at Ringling Ralph with a shovelful of coal perpetually in hand Helen forever up to her wrists in bread dough or Jordans were aAiinstructive couple about the labor that life could under their busy roof I was living for the first time with other children their two sons and a daughter The older boy Curtis thin and giggly was my age and we slept in the same bed and snickered in the dark at each others jokes Boarding out at the Jordans went smoothly enough then except at when Dad was to arrive and take me to A Friday night after Friday night he did not arrive Whatever Dad or Ruth or I had expected of this testing winter the unlookedfor happened the worst weather of thirty years blasted into the Sixteen country and Dad and Ruth found themselves in contest not so much with each other now but with the screaming white wilderness outside As bad winters are apt to do this one of whipped in early and hard Snow fell drifted crusted into gray crystal then fell and drifted and crusted gray again Dad and his hired man pushed the sheep in from the pastures to a big shed at the ranch buildings Nothing could root grass out of that solid snow The county road began to block for weeks at a time Winter was sealing the Sixteen country Doig 124 into long gray months of aloneness and I was cordoned from the life of Dad and Ruth there At last on the sixth Friday night long after I had given up hope again Dad appeared Even then he couldnt take me to the ranch with him he had spent ten hours fighting his way through the snow and there was the risk that the countryside would close off entirely again before he could bring me back to town Sunday night Tell ye what well do Skavinsky Talk to that teacher of yours and see if you can work ahead in your schoolwork If shell let you Ill come in somehow next Friday and you can come spend a couple of weeks out at the ranch All week whenever the recess bell rang I stayed at my desk and flipped ahead in one text or another piling up lesson sheets to hand to the bemused teacher school was out on Friday Dad came to the door of the classroom for me cocking his grin about clacking in with snowy overshoes and a girth of sheepskin coat4The highway down the valley was bare a black dike above the snow as he drove the pickup to the turnoff toward Battle Creek Then the white drifts stretched in front of us like a lake whose waves had suddenly stopped motion to hang in billows and peaks where the wind had lashed them against the sky1The very tops of fenceposts old gray cedar heads with rounded snow caps showed where the road was buried Between the post tops a set of ruts Doig 125 had been rammed and hacked by Dad and the few other ranchers who lived in the Sixteen country Dad drove into the sea of snow with big turns of the steering wheel keeping the front wheels grooved in the ruts while the rear end of the pickup jittered back and forth spinning snow out behind us Sometimes the pickup growled to a halt We would climb out and shovel away heavy chunks like pieces of an igloo Then Dad would back the pickup a few feet for a running start and bash into the ruts Once we went over a snowdrift on twin rows of planks another of the ranchers had laid for support a bridge in rnidcsea Once we drove entirely over the top of a drift without planks at all Where the road led up to the little Tat J7eWtt1 ro we angled between cliffs of snow higher than the pickup I Near Battle Creek with our headlights fingering past the dark into the white blankness Dad swerved off the road entirely and sent the pickup butting through the smaller drifts in a hayfield It had started to snow heavily the wind out of the Basin snaking the flurries down to sift into the ruts I watched the last miles roll up on the tiny numbers under the speedometer as Dad wrestled the wheel and began his soft Scots cussing Snow on a man will ye anyway git back in those ruts Darn suchweather Hold on son theres a ditch here somewhere The twentyfifth Doig126 mile the last we bucked down a long slope to the ranch with the heavy wet flakes flying at us like clouds of moths Dad roared past the lighted windows of the ranch house and spun the pickup inside the shelter of the lambing shed Done he said out into the storm Done damn ye To my surprise Battle Creek was not living up to its name and Dad and Ruth were getting along less edgily there than they ever had It may have been that there simply was so much work to be done feeding the sheep carrying in firewood melting snow for water because the pump had frozen that they had little stamina left over for argument Or perhaps they had decided that the winter had to be gotten through there simply was no route away from one another until spring Whatever accounted for it I slipped into its bask and warmed for the days to come Each morning Ruth stood at the window sipping from a white mug of coffee watching as Dad and the hired man harnessed the team to the hay sled Then if Dad had said they needed her that day she would pull on heavy clothing and go out and take the reins while the men forked hay off to the sheep Dad helped her in the house the two of them working better together at the meals and dishes than they had when they were feeding half the town in The Grill The pair of them even joked about the icy journey to the outhouse which started each day Whoever went first the other would Doig 127 demand to know whether the seat had been left good and warm It damn well ought to be the other would say half of my behind is still out on it Or Sure did I left it smoking for you The ranch house had been built with its living quarters on the second floor well above the long snowdrifts which duned against the walls A railed porch hung out over the snow the full length of the house and from it the other ranch buildings were in view like a small anchored fleet seen from a ships deck The lambing shed low and and enormously long seemed to ride fullladen in the white wash of winter Most of the time the sheep were corraled on the far side of the shed their bored bleats coming as far as the house if the wind was down Not far from the lambing shed stood the barn dark and bunched into itself prowing up out of the stillness higher than anything else in sight A few small sheds lay with their roofs disappearing in drifts swamped by this cold ocean of a winter Battle Creek flowed just beyond those sheds but the only mark of it was a gray skin of ice In this snow world Dad and his hired man skimmed back and forth on the hay sled a low wide hayrack on a set of runners pulled by a team of plunging workhorses I rode with the men hanging tight to the hayrack framing above where the horses hooves chuffed into the snow When the men talked Doig128 their puffs of breath clouded fatly out in front of their faces Our noses trickled steadily Dad put a mitten against my face often to see that my cheeks The winter fought us again and again Our dog crashed through the ice of Battle Creek and the wind carried the sound of his barking away from the house We found the shatter where he had tried to claw himself out before the creek froze him and then drowned him A blizzard yammered against the back wall of the house for two days without stop Outside the snow flew so thick it seemed there was no space left between the flakes in the air just an endless crisscross of flecks the whiteness of goose down When Dad and the hired man went to feed the sheep they would disappear into the storm swallowed thirty feet from the window where Ruth and I watched An afternoon when the weather let up briefly I climbed the slope behind the house to where a long gully troughed toward Battle Creek Snow had packed the gulch so full that I could sled down over its humps and dips for hundreds of feet at a time Trying out routes I flew off a fourfoot shale bank and in the crash sliced my right knee on the end of a sled runner as if I had falled against an axe blade That moment of recall is dipped in a hot red ooze The bloody slash scared out my breath in a long uhhhhh A clench ran through the inside of me then the instant heat of tears burned below my eyes The climb from the gulch was steep Doig129 Now the burning fell to my leg Blood sopped out as I hobbled to the house with both hands clamped over my wound and Ruth shook as she snipped away the heavystained pants leg The cut she quickly told me did not live up to its first horrific gush it was long but shallow and clean and dressings easily took care of it In a few days I could swing my leg onto the hay sled and again ride with the men above the horses white frosted heels The two weeks passed in surges of that winter weather like tides flowing in long and hard On the last morning no snow was falling but Dad said so much had piled by then that we could get to town only by team and sled Ruth said she wanted to go with us Dad looked at her once and nodded Dad and the hired man lifted the rack off hay boat and fixed a seat of planks onto the front pair of sled runners Inside that seat blankets piled thickly onto the heavy coats we wore we sat buried in warmth almost down in the snow as the horses tugged us along on the running bob Harness buckles sang a chingtink chingtink with every step of the horses Dad slapped the reins against the teams rumps and headed us toward the hayfields along Battle Creek The road would be no help to us drift humped onto drift there by now We would aim through meadows and bottomlands where the snow lay flatter The greyness stretching all around us baffled my eyes Doig130 Where I knew hills had to be no hills showed The sagebrush too had vanished from a countryside forested with its clumps One gray sheet over and under and around the snow and overcast had fused land and sky together Even our sleigh was gray and halfhidden weathered ash moving like a pale shadow through ashen weather Dad headed the team by the tops of fenceposts and where the snow had buried even them by trying to pick out the thin besieged hedge of willows along the creek I peeked out beside Ruth the two fogs of our breath blowing back between us as the horses found footing to trot More often they lunged at the snow breaking through halfway up their thick legs Dad talked to the horses every little while Hup there Luck get your heft into it Pull a bit damn ye Bess Up this rise now get yourself crackin there Their ears would jab straight up when they felt the flat soft slap of the reins and heard Dads voice and they would pull faster and we would go through the snow as if the sled was a running creature carrying us on its back The twin cuts of our sled tracks the only clear lines the snow had not yet had time to seize and hide traced away farther and farther behind us Except for the strides of the horses and Dads words to them the country was silent held so under the weight of the snow In my memory that day has become a set of instants somewhere between life and death Doig131 a kind of eclipse in which hours did not pass and sound did not echo all color washed to a flannel sameness and distance swelling away beyond any counting of it We went into that f ogworld at one end of Battle Creek and long after came out at the other but what happened in between was as measureless as a float through space If it was any portion of existence at all it did not belong to the three of us but to that winter which had frozen all time but its own After that ghostly trip I went back to my boarding family and Dad and Ruth went on with the struggle against the winter It was another month or so before Dad arrived to take me to the ranch again This time we drove across the drifted world inside a plowed canyon the slabs and mcimnds of frozen snow wrenched high as walls on either side of the thin route Weve had a D8 dozer in here the government sent it out when it looked like we were all gonna lose the livestock out here I had to get a truckload of cottonseed cake sent in for the sheep the hays goin so damn fast They put the bumper of that truck right behind the dozer and even so it tookYem sixtysix hours to make it to the ranch and back can ye feature that That load of cottoncake is gonna cost us 2500 in transportation but we had to have 1er I looked at him as if hed said the moon was about to fall on us 2500 sounded to me like all the money in the state of Montana But Dad grinned and talked on You should of been out here Doig132 to see all the snowplowin After they dozed out our haystacks the crew was supposed to go up and doze out Jim Bill Keiths place I was the guy that was showin them the way ridin the front end of that Cat Hell I got us lost on the flats up hereAsame damn country I grew up in yknow and we dozed in a bi circle before we knew goin on Plowed up a quarter of a mile and dLdn t even know it Blizzardin boy its been ablowin out here son They came out in one of them snow crawlers to change Ct crewsJ changed em with an airplane when they first started i but the weather got so bad they couldnt flyf sohere they come now in one of these crawlers and the IUY drivin is drunkern eight hundred dollars I thought he was gonna bring that damned crawler through the window of the house I laughed with him but must have looked worried He grinned again Were doin okai in spite of it all Havent lost any sheep yet and that cottoncake gives us plenty of feed If this winter dont last into the summer were even gonna make some pretty good money on the deal Then in the next weeks came an afternoon when Dad saddled a horse and plunged off through the weather to the neighboring Keith ranch He came up here wanting to borrow some cigarettes and some whiskey Probably the with Ruth was wearing through by then Dad idled in the kitchen talking and drinking coffee with Mrs Keith while waiting for Doig133 Jim Bill and his hired man to come back from feeding their cattle I remember yes your dad had ridden UE on a little sorrel horse and he was sitting in the kitchen with Flossie and he kept looking out at this kind of a red knob out here on the hill He looked and he looked and pretty soon he jumped up and yelled Its broke its broke and he ran outside And that winter WAS broke The hired man and I carreriding home with our earf laps rolled up and our coats I off and our mittens stuck in the forkhole of the saddle Just like that The chinook which had begun melting the snowdrifts even as Dad watched did signal the end of that ferocious winter and somehow too it seemed to bring the end of the long storm within our household Before neither Dad nor Ruth had been able to snap off the marriage Now they seemed in a contest to do it first like a pair tugging at a stubborn wishbone 4 Near the start of summer Ruth announced she was leaving this time for all time Dad declared it the best idea hed ever heard out of her Alone with Ruth sometime in the swash and swirl of all this I asked why she had to go She gave me her tough grin shook her head and said Your dad and me are never gonna get along together Were done We gave it our try Why it was that the two of them had to endure that winter together before Ruth at last could go from Dad I have never Doig 134 fathomed Perhaps it was a final show of endurance against one another some way to say I can last at this as long as you can But that long since had been proved by both and it is one of the strangenesses of this time that they had to go on and on with the proof of it A last strangeness came iilld the diyorce been handed down 9ESeliL over these years even after Ruth had vanished from us 7 one last unrelenting echo of it all Dad no longer would even refer to Ruth by name Instead he took up something provided by one of the onlookers to our households civil war Naturally the valley had not been able to resist choosing up sides in such a squabble and a woman coming to Dads defense reached for anything contemptible enough to call Ruth At last she spluttered flip For whatever reason that Victorian blurt rang perfectly with Dad put him in the right in all the arguments he was replaying in his mind From the moment the surprising word got back to him he would talk of Ruth only as Flip that damned Flip Ruth went and Flip stayed one single poisoned word which was all that was left of two persons misguess about one another I have not seen Ruth for twenty years nor spoken with her for twentyfive But for a time after those few warring years with my father her life straightened perhaps like a piece of metal seethed in fire for the anvil She married again there was a son And then calamity anew Doig135 that marriage in wreckage and another after that the town voice saying more than ever of her She thinks everything should come in a cloud for her but she has hatefulness in herself until at last she had gone entirely disappeared somewhere out onto the Coast nobodys cared to keep track of her The son I am curious about him Was he taken by Ruth to see the grandmother blinking back age and blindness Did Ruth stand with him white mug of coffee in her hand to watch snow sift on a winters wind But the curiosity at last stops there When Dad and Ruth finally pulled apart the one sentiment I could sinceJwas relief M recognize within melhave recognized ever M that she had gone and that the two of them could do no more harm to each other Once more Dad had to right our life and this time he did it simply by letting the seasons work him up and down the valley He went to one ranch as foreman of the haying crew on to another to feed cattle during the winter to a third for spring and the lambing seasonJtwhen school started and I could not be with him he rented a cabin in White Sulphur and drove out to his ranch work in the morning and back at night During the winter and in springs busyness of lambing I usually boarded with Nellie and his wife in their fine log house Nellies wife was a world of improvement from Ruth M a quiet approvinSwoman head up and handsome In the pasture behind their house she raised palomino horses flowing animals Doig136 of a rich golden tan and with light blonde manes of silk The horses seemed to represent her independence her declaration away from Nellies life of drinking and she seemed to think Dad was right in letting me be as free and roaming as I was would It occurs to me now that given me her quiet approving smile if I had come home from a wandering to report that Id just been down at the Grand Central watching a hayhand knife a sheepherder And after her season of calm Dad began one for us together When the summer of 1950 came he bought a herd of cattle and we moved them and ourselves to a cattle camp along Sixteenmile Creek There our life held a simpler pace than I could ever remember The two of us lived in a small trailer house the only persons from horizon to horizon and several miles beyond Dad decided to reach me to shoot a 22 rifle using as targets the tan gophers which every horseback man hated for the treacherous little burrows they dug We shot by the hour rode into the hills every few days to look at the cattle caught trout in the creek watched the Milwaukee Railroad trains clip past four times every day1Then I had my eleventh years since my mother had diedf and it seemed to trigger a decision in Dad Something had been working at him a mist of despond and unsteady health which would take him off into himself for hours at a time Doig 137 One evening in the weeks after my birthday after he had been silent most of the day he told me a woman would be corning into our lives again His words rolled a new planet under our feet so astonishing fi s pro Sfit c tJ and unlikely had come and gone without much I lasting effect except for the scalded mood Dad showed whenever he had a reason to mention her But the person he had in mind now cast a shadowline across everything ahead of us stood forth as the one apparition I could not imagine into our way of life My mothers mother
