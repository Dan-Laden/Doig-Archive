 I Doig1 I 11Jl S lZIC f CI BrlfITIUJ1h I oon before daybreak on my sixth birthday my mothers breathing wheezed more raggedly than ever then quieted And then stopped rtIV t 2 begins out of that new silence Through the tine I since I reach back along my fathers tellings and around the urgings which would have me face about and forget to feel into these oldest shadows for the first sudden edge of it all It starts early in the mountain summer far back among the high spilling slopes of the Bridger Range of southwestern Montana The single sound is hidden water the south fork VI of Sixteenmile Creek diving down its willowtiTasked gulch The stream flees north through this secret and peopleless land It until under the of Hatfield Mountain a bow ti r f er v1 i r of meadow cur wide to the west At this interruption a low rumple of the mountain knolls itself up watchfully and Doig2 atop it like a sentry box over the frontier between the sly creek and the prodding meadow perches our singleroom herding cabin Alonetere on our abrupt tiny shelf the three of us eased through May and the first days of June secure as hawks with wind under our wings Once a week the camptender from the home ranch would come the dozen miles of trail to us The sorrel he rode and the packhorse haltered behind would plod in from the shadows which pooled in our valley under the shouldering slopes until at last the rider stepped off from his stirrups into the cabin clearing and S CJ unknotted from the packsaddle the r s a ra iv d c r f wJ te as iny cloud whic btliqed lwi trn our groceries and mail My father with his wise tucked grin surely tossed a joke Hullo Willie Bring us that side of Tbones and a barrel of whiskey this time did ye Ive told ye and told ye our menu needs some fancying up As surely my mother would have appeared from the cabin her small smile bidding the caller to the tin mug of coffee in her hands As surely 6 again I would have been at the provision as my father began to unpack them poking for the tightrolled bundle of comic books which came for me with the mail Minutes later the camptender would be resaddled and riding from sight For the next seven mornings again until his hat and shoulders began to show over the trail crest another Doig3 time only the three of us nestled there in the clean blue weather of the soundless mountains Three of us and the sheep scattered down meadow slopes like a slow slow avalanche of fleeces Before I was born my mother and father had lived other herding summers shadowing after the sheep through the long pure days until the lambs that were on those slopes then The summer we were married and went herding on Grass Mountain all that country was just alive with grouse then Id shoot them five at a time and your motherkyour motherd cook them at noon when the sheep had shaded up Wed eat one apiece seal the rest in quart jars and cool them in the spring water so wed have them cold for supper They were the best eatin in this world Lot of times wed have them for breakfast too before we moved camp Y see on forest reserve iou re supposed to move camp about every day The first summer there on Grassy we moved camp fift eicrht times in the first sixty days We had a brand new box camera we were awful proud of and wed take a picture of campsite tme Your mother The pair of words would break him then and fool that I could be I would look aside from his struggling face In these afteryears it is my turn for the struggle inside the eyes and along the drop of throat for I have the album pages of those campsites along the ridgelines and the swale Doig 4 meadows of their first summer mountain Off the stiff black pages two almostStrangers grin up into my eyes like past neighbors seen again across too at all I know and do not know of My father looks stronger than I ever knew him and even more handsome the straight broad lines of his face framed cleanly around the dimpleScar in the center of his chin His stockmans hat has been crimped carefully sits on his head at a perfect angle Hisshoulders line out level and very wide for a man just five and a half feet tall but this strength at the top of him trims away to a lower body slender as a boys I am reminded that he was so slim down the waist and hips that the seat of his pants forever bagged in and the tongue of his belt had to flap far past the as if trying to circle him twice Certain photos catch as almost mischievous cocking the dry which sneaks onto my own face as I look at him In others there is a distance to him a sense that except for accident he might be anywhere else in the world just now and maybe a being entirely unlike the one I knew here In any pose he looks at the camera squarely himself a kind of lens aimed back at the moment To see him the several hims encamped across the pages is to begin listening for the burred voice the retellings the veers and jogs of his life Ivan I think Ill take on those two bands of sheep for ev ofI Doig5 McGrath Hes a bearcat to work for but the sonofabuck knows livestock and he knows how to turn That place was a haywire outfit from the start or Ill put in with you They had men on that place that by God you wouldnt send to fetch a bucket of water or theyd bring it back upside down Cliff and I stood it for about a week then we told the boss to write er out for us we were heading for town This doctor now I dont know about him If I was in as good a shape as he says I am I wouldnt be sick atal l Again the sentences snap I see the handsome steady mouth clamp itself the chindot of scar come close beneath small but deep like a tool mark nicked in when his strong head was carved A single quick notch at the bottom of his face as if it might be the first lightest scratch of calamity on him But my mother my mother here in some summer of early marriage already seems frail so slimJ too light a being to last there so near the challenge of timberline Again because I know what was to come I believe myself into the notion that I can read it all gathering on the albums somber paper I print into my mind from her every pose how fineboned she was hardly more than tiny with a roundish slightly wondering face where most of my own is quickly read I coax from the photos all detail which seems to tell the sickness Doig6 eroding in her the pinch across her slender shoulders the eyes which are almost too calm and accepting But the one thing which would pulse her alive for me does not come I do not know the sound of her voice am never to know it Instead she is wound in the other voices tracked through the years Her teacher at the oneroom schoolhouse in a sea of sage The first morning of school here I saw this girl coming up on a black horse just as fast as ever she could And it was your mother and she was rushing up to tell me there were mice in the well and not to use that water The ranchers wife who had neighbored with her in some summer of haying I wouldnt see anione for hours and I would go across to your house and there your mother would be reading to you Shed read by the hour on a hot afternoon shed keep you so cool and quiet just sitting there reading She was so quiet had such a soft fine voice The forest ranger who oversaw their range that early season on GrassMountain She could do about anything a man couldcride sling a pack any of that She even knew how to trap We talked sometimes about runnin a trapline and I know she did in winters later on But she had to be careful yknow anything she did or shed choke right down short of breath Yes This album of summers again as if I might finger through the emulsion patterns to the moments themselves At the backs of my familiar photoed strangers always a forest Doig 7 and always spattering down through the pine boughs to their rough shirt fronts The canvas slopes of their tent are triangled grayly at the back of the day camp Two black herding dogs ears up in dog surprise study the lens A pair of saddlehorses gawk in from the grassy fringes of camp as if afraid any attention might go by them One creature in these early pictures does not fit and this intrigues rnethe pet Which is being stroked in my mothers hands Those first seasons of following the sheep my parents kept with them in their daily sift through the foresta cat an independent grayandwhite torn they had named Pete Olson Somehow amid the horses and dogs and sheep and the coyotes and bobcats which ranged close to camp Pete Olson rationed out his nine lives in nightly prowls of the mountain Then as camp was moved each morning he would be cradled like a prince between J somebodys lap and the saddle pommel as the horses shouldered through the timber My parents were childless then told by doctors that they might always be If the prediction had held if I had never been would any but the astral glance of a cat ever have seen into those far summers of theirs Would that time be different for not having met my eyes Yet the two are met and in this season on the final mountain the surprising drifter ducking through swags of pine branches on the back of a horse has become me Later my father would never tire of telling what a cantankerous Doig 8 source of pride I made in that riding family The only thing we could get you on was a sawbuck pack saddle You know what they are like a little sawhorse setting on top of the saddle rigging Hard as a rasp to sit on but you straddled in there like it was treonly thing going Ride sometimes half a day in it You were a stubborn little dickens This with the grin up at me as I loomed half a head over him As I tried to find in myself that small flinty son from the past Wherever it may point my own clearest moment of myself I sf in that far summer ha I the mood of sober cussedness he recalled I had been given a bow and a few arrows likely an early gift for my birthday Time and again my arrows whacked far from the paper target my father had tacked to the side of the cabin I see myself pouting it out kicking at the tan bunchgrass as I think as the creek makes its shying mutter Then I edge close to the cabin wall until the round sharp tip of the arrow hangs inches from the paper I let go the bowstring and the bullseye slashes open with a hard snapping sound That with every instant of remembering clear as the noon air Yet of my mothers death whatever I try just a single flicker dim and hurtful ever is called back the asthma has claimed her there are only two breathings in the cabin now my father is touching me awake in lantern glow his shadow hurled high up onto the wall to say she is dead Ivan your mother is dead sobbing as the words choke him Doig 9 The start of memorys gather June 27 1945 I have become six years old my mothers life has drained out at 31 years And in the first gray daylight dully heading our horses around from that cabin of the past my father and I rein away toward all that would come next i JI 0 Doig10 is a set of sagas we live by much the way of fhe Norse wildmen in their bear shirts That such rememberings take place in a single cave of brain rather than half a hundred minds warrened wildly into one another makes them sagas no less By now my days would seem blank unlit if these familiar surges could not come A certain turn in my desk chair and the leather cushion must creak the quick dry groan of a saddle under my legs Land my fathers and his fathers The taste in the air as rain comes over the city is forever a flavor back from a Montana community too tiny to be called a town A man the same alphabet of college degrees after his name as mine trumps in a debating point during a party argument and my grandmothers words mutter in me on cue that he grins like a jackass eating thistles Rote moments these mysteryless perhaps in themselves It is where they lead and with what fitful truth and deceit that tantalizes If somewhere beneath the blood the past must beat in me to make a rhythm of survival for go on as this halflife which echoes as a second pulse inside the ticking moments of my existenceMif this is what must be why is the pattern of remembered instants so uneven so gapped and rutted and plunging and soaring I can only believe it is because memory takes its pattern from the earliest moments in the mind from childhood And childhood is a most queer and shadowchilled time Think once Doig11 more how the world wavers and intones above us then Parents behave down toward us as if they are tribal gods as old and unarguable and almighty as thunder Other figures loom in from next door and the schoolyard and a thousand lanes of encounter count coup on us with whatever lessons of life they brandish then ghost off We peek into ourselves and find deviling there as well most tricksterish high chant Riddles are delight at its Thirtytwo white horses on a red hill Now theyre tramping now theyre champing now theyre standing still other triumph to you Where are they In your mouth Bafflement to the And darker frolic this first sudden set of years also is the one season of life for most of us when we can kill worse simply from curiosity to see how the tiny mice prodded from their field nest are different dead from the tiny mice alive of an instant ago Cruelty comes new to us and astonishing yet we are at our cruelest to each other mocking playmates home in sobs Marauders we are marauded too Darkness blankets down around a child as if the planets caves have emptied all their shadows over him Everything fights the childs ambitionsfences reach too high streets stretch too wide days too short and too long Imagination is the single constantftiena of the child and even imagination does its hare of betrayal scowls itself in some stalled passage of time into scaredness and doubt Doig12 Just so does life blaze and haunt around us before we learn we are sober creatures of civilization Just so when childhood itself has passed into the distance behind me does my remembering of the story that begins with my mothers last breath go on the way it was recklessly shaped in me then
