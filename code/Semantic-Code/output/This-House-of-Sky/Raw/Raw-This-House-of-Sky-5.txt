 Doiq 230 NORTH s the Irish fellow savs this place must be the back of the neck of the world For once my fathers damnation of a ranch was underdone he could have peppered in a few dozen of the Irish fellows forlornest cusswords in justice to this one We had come the hours of distance north from the Smith River Valley and driven onto the ranch during the night As Dad puzzled through the darkness along fainter and fainter sctuffs of prairie road our three styles of apprehension began to cloak in on us Before we were halfway Grandma demanded Gee gollies arent we never gonna get there Dad notched his chin ahead another full inch and choked the steering wheel as if it had betrayed Doig231 him I tried to stare shapes out of the blackness but could find only an occasional jackrabbit racing in the net edge of our headlights At last Dad gave a start began to brake the pickup down a sudden careen of slope and the headlights fingered wildly onto a squat white building By gee at last That was Grandma not a word out of Dad Where is the place down in a hole like this More silence from him As we stumbled from the car toward the house the white walls too seemed to hold back from us in the dark ghostly and telling nothing of themselves Daylight did all the telling we wanted Testing doors we found ourselves locked off from all but the back three rooms of the housela small bedroom for Grandma one hardly larger for Dad and me and a highceilinged cavern of a kitchen McGraths doings Ill warrant you Grandma announced rightly in haggling for the lease he had euchred a point of some sort with the ranchowning family by allowing them to store their belongings in the front portion of the house From a keyhole I reported up to Dad and Grandma that furniture and boxes were piled all around a broad bewindowed living room with other rooms opening off as well Plainly the divvy of the house had dealt the larger half here to dust and silence In alarm we studied the ungainly little set of rooms left to us and the single narrow envelope of view out the Doig 232 kitchen windows to a dilapidating bunkhouse the outhouse f and a bit of brown treeless ramp of slope sheering up to the benchland Even Grandma couldnt come up with words I for the situation although the line of her jawrsaid she was working on it She and I went out to peer in the windows of the denied rooms as if we needed to confirm McGraths treachery I glanced around toward the silverboarded sheepshed which squatted hugely across the yard from us At least I tried in what I thought was entirely grownup sarcasm old McGrath got us a scadof room for the sheep But Grandmas attention had hit on the bleak bench of land rimming above us to the south where the road curled in She turned and the same bench rimmed over us in the west Another turn and an identical flat lid of horizon to the north She rotated to the last chance the east and was met with rimming benchland again like the fourth lip of a vast squarepit Hmpf House in a hollow makes the weather follow she recited slammed away into the back of the house and wouldnt be spoken to for the rest of the morning Dad and I walked around the outbuildings The sheepshed spread itself big beyond relief bunkered along the base of a slope for a full forty yards then elling off into the coulee for another forty then closed around with a high board fence like a stockade The one thing such expanse Doig233 insured was endless walking for the day manjDadduring N M lambing time Moose of a damn place he muttered now as if looked q llJ trying to shrink it Weathered and dour as a fortress the sheepshed to have crouched on its site eternally Every other building in the ranch yard however reared from open ground to open sky as though spilled into place hard only an eyeblink before Nothing greater than a spear of grass backed the buildingsno brushy windbreak no board fence not even a pitying fluff of sage as the valley would have provided As for trees the entire sum of them on the 2500acre ranch twoMhunched low at the front of the house evidently trying to cower in out of the wind McGrath had told us that this leasehold it was called the Jensen ranch1began as a homestead which meant that people had lived here from at least forty years earlier How had they never managed to make the place look less stark From where we stood a machine shed yawned with disuse on one side of us a granary shed answered on the other Between the pair bulked a barn built of notched logs and its browngray mass only made the sheds look all the more cadaverous Everything in sightlground barn sheds a rusting windmillwas slightly aslant as if the impact of the giant sheepshed at the bottom of the yard had teetered the entire ranch toward it It was when Dad noticed that he hadnt yet found a place Doig234 on the ranch where he could stand without one foot lower than the other that he pronounced the Irish fellows lament on our new home Then Aw the hell Skavinsky we might as well go see what the grass looks like0and the two of usMneither willing to risk a peace gesture in Grandmas direction I yetdrove back up the long snout of benchland in front of the house We came up over the crest and were walled to a stop The western skyline before us was filled high with a steel blue army of mountains drawn in battalions of peaks and reefs and gorges and crags as far along the entire rim of the earth as could be seen Summit after summit bladed up thousands of feet as if charging into the air to strike first at storm and lightning valleys and clefts chasmed wide as if split and hollowed by thunderblast upon thunderblast Across the clear gape of distance we could read where black quilled forest wove in beneath cliffs and back among the plummet of canyons we could make out the beds of scree crumbled and scattered beneath the marching shields of rimrock The Smith River Valley had had mountain ranges all around This highset horizon twenty miles to our west thrust itself as if all those past ranges and twice their number more had been tumbled together and then armored with rimrock and icefield Off this caromline of summits we knew the Continental Divide tipped rivers away to both the Pacific and the Atlantic Doig235 The shouldering might of what and I were looking at seemed as if it could send those entire oceans too sloshing along routes of flow if the notion struck Then as the pair of us stared and cleared our throats to one another we began to see a thing more Along these mastering mountains all the hundred miles of gashing skyline in our sight fresh snow was draping down Here was a thought Dad and I had lived our lifetimes beneath weatherrnaking mountains none of which tusked up into storm clouds as mightily as this Sawtooth Range of the Rockies would In front of us now loomed the reefline of the entire continent where the surf of weather broke and came flooding across and both of us knew what could be ahead when full winter poured down off north Yet for the instant to have come UfOn grandness anywhere near this spavined ranch neither of us had the heart to care Down from the mountains as well it turned out this north country stretched as a land of steady expanse of crispmargined distances set long and straight on the earth All the obliques of our valley life seemed to have been erased and redrawn here as ruleredged plateaus of grassland furrowed panels of grainfield arrowing roads creeks nosing quick and bright from the Rockies The clean lines of this fresh landscape everywhere declared purpose and capacity Doig 236 seemed to trumpet Here are the far bounds all the extent anyone could need Now live up to them Dad stepped from the pickup slid his hands into his hip pockets and studied the shards and shields of tli Rockies and then the boldedged I north and south and east Dandy country he said and turned to grin wide at me As the fellow says just dandy fine Lets go tackle that Lady situation Dad by now had learned a considerable trove about how to handle Grandmalthe remainder of his problem being that H there seemed to be some dozens of troves yet to be figured out about herLand he had hit on what was needed to get her mind off the alarming ranch We got to figure some place for Ivan to stay for school Lady These roads are gonna be too much to drive every day when winter sets in this country What do ye think we ought to do The perpetual problem of basing me somewhere roused her Well we ought to go into whatsjtsnarne Dupuyer and see whats what oughtnt we Criminentlies that seems to me how to do Now she looked Dad full in the face acknowledging him with challenge Dont it to you It did and we drove the nine dirt miles north to Dupuyer luckily a briefer route than the bramble of roads we had correin by from the south We noticed with no surprise that the Jensen ranch looked like an elderly addled cousin of the trim ranches along the way Then our dirt road at Doig237 last sneaked itself to the highway and down from a ridgeL v1 this north seemed to be all flat ridgeline where it wasnt iceberg lay tucked along a broad band of brush v1hich marked its namesake creek Off from either side of the highway which doubled for an instant as the main street a few dozen houses and buildings lined away like a Ringling which had been ordered to close in its ranks and paint itself up toward respectability The first of the towns businesses we came to had one sign advertising it as a gas station and another declaring it a cafe as if the enterprise hadnt entirely been able to make up its mind and decided to take on both jobs While Dad and I searched out someone to put gas in the pickup Grandma marched into the cafesign side of the building and asked the woman behind the counter if she knew anyone who would board a high school boy The woman at once plunged into thought her lips set barely open as if in a soundless whistle This question from a stranger seemed to have taken over hcile lifel until flnally she had to shake her head and say No just nobody comes to mind I guess most people arent willing to take in someone they dont know like that Grandma locked the woman with her steadfast look Well how about you then That clamping look and those words began my stay with the Chadwick family Gertie the woman of the cafe said Doig 238 afterward that her agreement came as an hunch which startled her as she said it after all she had not laid eyes on me yet But your grandma just had a way about her I liked her right then and figured I might like you We would learn in turn that Grandma had landed me with three people it was impossible not to cherish Gertie Chadwick herseJcf was Dupuyer s touchstone Short and square set almost boxyLher parents had been stocky M immigrants from Belgium and the family line had gone even broader and more shortnecked with herjshe stubbed m up above the top of the cafe counter But somehow there was the energy packed in her to run her enterprise as busily and fondly as if it were a boardinghouse table and the many dozens qf customers made up the most interesting crew on earth She kept open for business days of the year at Christmas she would come downtcw n in the forenoon to feed the pensioned herders and widowers and others who took their every meal with her then resolutely go home for the holiday afternoon In daybyday trade travelers trooped in to her plentifully enough as was guaranteed by Dupuyers spot as the lone stopover of its sort amid a kinking eightymile stretch of the highway which led north to Glacier National Park and Canada But Gerties main service was to provide the community itself with brimming coffee cups and the daily victual of chat to go with the brew Ranchers Doig 239 and farmers spilled in as they passed through town You fellows whove got winter wheat in will be able to be called Mister this fall Itll be a beaner if I can get er harvested in this christly weather They hailed out up across the Marias Pounded the damned wheat flat to the ground Looks like eightyfive pound lambs up on the Reservation Just a world of grass for em up there this year Other hours their wives made their call on the way to buy groceries for a ranch crew or to fetch a machinery part needed in the grain harvest or just to trade news with one another But the most precise and valued of Gerties customers were her regulars the lone men who bought meals from her by the month and arrived for them three times a day like figures marching across the face of an elaborate tower clock as certain hours are struck Since I took my meals side by side with them the regulars eyed me briefly learned that I was from a fending family and could see that I already was doing some of it for myself and dealt me into their corps A tiny ancient homesteader named Fred Groh at once told me of arriving Dupuyer when he was my age and at the break of spring hearing the thaw wind begin its down across the crags of the Rockies They told me it was the chinook and I wondered what kind of animal that could be to make a noise like that The gentle and gray postmaster Doig240 John Wall eased in from across the street puffing his pipe thoughtfully as he sparred jokes with Gertie She upped the odds once by snipping a circle of cardboard and sliding it beneath the meat patty in his daily hamburger As she turned back to the kitchen he spotted the disc and slipped it out Wordlessly he ate aNay as Gertie gnawed at her lip At last from her Dont you notice anything about that hamburger at all He dabbed napkin to lips and gave me a slow wise wink No sir Gertie it tastes just like your hamburgers always do A gnomefaced man named Joe Smith mocked himself with little stories about his livelihood as a fur trapper laughed with a hawhawhaw which shook him all over disappeared betweentimes to the tra ines he had set along the creeks beneath the mountains Gerties husband Harold noticed my interest in this halfphantomthere was little Harold did not noticeand began mumbling information M That Joeby the god he can catch any beaver he wants to How the hell he does it I dunno Hell go out there to a beaver dam and catch all the bi9ones leave the little ones These ranchersll ask him to catch all them beaver but huhuh he leaves them little ones for seed by the god for next year Gertie herself must have heard twenty dozen times everything that was ever said around that counter yet I noticed that she listened as readily as if every word was new to her and Doig241 encouraged the talk with a rich openmouthed chuckle which te her entirely the way Grandmas question had done This cafe of hers and its place in the life of Dupuyer I quickly came to see reflected exactly this new landlady of mine plain to look at hearty the day long and in polished affections The polish swiped away at once when you stepped over the doorsill from the cafe into Harold Chadwicks service station The place was a conglomerate of workshop and junkyard massed with mechanical gear and tools which seemed to have dropped down to catch their breath before seizing onto the next project The rear of the station at any given time might house amid the gasping hoods of cars a demotored tractor or an axleless truck or a grain combine towering like a freighter in dry dock Somewhere in the midst of it would be Harold himself I a tall wizard cobbling away at the community of machinery with deep pondering sighs Luckily Harolds hands spoke for him because listening to him otherwise you caught only those profound sighs or a thin mutter which seemed to come mostly via his nose or sheer silence Soon after I began to board with the Chadwicks a stint came when Gertie hired someone to run the cafe in the evenings and so would feed us supper at home with Harold arriving to eat by himself whenever he found space between Doig 242 waiting repairs Once after he made his wordless come and go I went to the kitchen and joked to Gertie Harold mustve been here for his supper hmm I heard the kitchen door slam twice She whooped with appreciation and to my alarm retold the lines to Harold when he came home after closing He looked across at me in surprise as I waited warily and then gave me a great dark silent grin The Chadwicks had a son a few years older than I wasJTommy Chad as the townspeople sometimes lilted about this Tommy worked at the service station with his father and had inherited the magic with machines His mothers thickset look had rebuilt itself on himanvil shoulders and solid beams of arms his neck a collar of heft blocky power anywhere you lookedJuntil he seemed almost a brother to the machinery under repair from his blunt deft fingers Tommys mulling effort to make his head speak as well as his hands gave him a quiet watchfulness much like my owrr Since each of us had been raised alone as best our families had been able to find time for us and each had come out of it with a knack the other didnt my diet of books his touch for machinerywe appreciated each other by a kind of survivors instinct like a Brazilian and a Lapplander somehow falling into step in the same beside the pair of us as we forked down a meal at the cafe counter in comfortable silence turned and said You two dont have much to say Doig243 for yourselves do you Tommy gave it an instant then No Just enough The three Chadwicks had a steadiness about them which carried out into their town Dupuyer unlike Ringling or White Sulphur Springs seemed never to have had the least hesitation about its livelihood since the first wagonmaster wearily overnighted on the site sometime in the 1870s In a meander between the horizon of mountains and the horizon of plains the freighters trail had marked itself northwestward through Montana from the steamboat landing at Fort Benton on the Missouri to the early Royal Canadian Mounted Police posts in Alberta Even after the railroad speared cross continent to the north the trail stayed busy as a capillary for mail and stage shipments out into the remote country edging the Rockies and their foothills And all the while the special site of plentiful grass and a constant creek was making itself into a merchandising settlement The country rimming it to the west was found to be fine for sheep and a local rancher named Oliver Goldsmith Cooper became president of the potent Montana Wool Growers Association Before the turn of the century a quarter million pounds of fleece were being shipped from the Dupuyer Creek ranches each year From then on Dupuyer added little population lost less it somehow had found a spot of balance between the range hills Doig 244 and the farming plains and the equilibrium set the towns mood Once a year for about a week toward the end of winter everybody gets at throats Gertie explained to me Then the chinook comes and we all get along together for another year One store three gas stations three saloons the cafe t some few hundred feet of sidewalk a few dozen houses a couple of barns several overtopping groves of cottonwoods long winters pushing winds a hundred people and a highway trenching it into halves That was Dupuyer entire and uncomplaining and it won me in a week with its tidy life and the caress of its past For the first time I could remember I was living in a town which had a pace of life both useful and civil and some deserved contentment with itself over that fact With the Chadwicks I was enfolded in a family which held warmths more constant than I was used to even in the sunnier parts of the cycles of Dad Grandma myself Eventhe Jensen ranch was proving less woebegone than expected in my weekends there with Dad and Grandma The place was so basic after of of a big ranch such as the Camas that there was way A to apply great effort to it and Dad and Grandma were able to slacken their fierce work habits a bit Beyond that they too seemed to take pleasure from Dupuyer and the Chadwicks to feel less edgy than any of us had for a long time Told Doig 245 ye this north country was worth a try Dad crowed I agreed entirely for the first few then plummeted into a time when I wished I were anywhere else on the continent The tripwire was in my new high school Because Dupuyer had never reached the size to have its own high school its handful of students jounced by bus to the larger town of Valier twenty miles east across thefarm plains Unlike Dupuyer which simply had sprigged up by a trailside Valier had been grandly planted as the headquarters town for an 80000acre irrigation project which had been ditched onto the prairie early in the century Now the town had the somewhat alarmed air of having built too much of itself for the size of its caretaking jobrempty blocks yawned away from and sometimes through its neighborhoods and what had been allotted as a sizable downtown held only a single thin street of businesses The high school too seemed to spread more than was called for crouching broadly and determinedly across most of a block as if putting roots into the earth Inside the building flung itself open in the wide gaunt logic of a frontier fort 11 a vast central room like a parade ground with students desks soldiered into file class by class all across the center and classrooms sentried regularly around the side walls All in all there seemed to be a grayish barrack like feeling to the place and I stepped in on my first morning with doubt crowding high in my throat Doig 246 By more luck than I could have prayed for four of us arrived new to this school of a hundred students on the same midNovember day Another of these newcomers rode the bus from Dupuyer with meJcarlton who was a year or two older than I was and boasted a tooth black hair slicked back like an ebony skullcap and he began reciting as soon as he slipped into the seat beside mettYour folks run sheep huh Sod the folks of my girlfriend last summer She had to herd goddamn things in this field see so Jeep see Then wed roar out after those goddamn sheep and round em in Run right over the woolly bastards if they didn tinove fast enoughsee I s tened with in te restanything about girls and 411 and the unknown gulch at the new white worlds of their breasts the top of an i tern to Carltons tale was boggling I didnt know whether to be more astonished at the vision of a girl naked in a Jeep or at daring to run over a sheep Disappointed in me as an audience sidled off toward the back of the busfin a minute his murmurs were going again do it right there run right over the woolly With the lighthouse wink of that tooth and his insistent exploit Carlton drew off attention in our first few days at Valier But my camouflage of quiet faded quickly Too Doig 247 many times each schoolday I would look up and meet a set of cool gray eyes which could have outdrilled even Grandmas The face around them was darkabrowed unadorned and somehow both musing and ominous Frances Carson Tidyman who through a full generation had been scanning the students in her English classes as if they were muddy pebbles in a sluice box had me under her steadiest focus What I already had begun to know about Mrs Tidyman was as unsettling as her stare She was the least likely presence to be found in a small farmtown schoolr a mysteriously spiced waft of booklore and speculative notions and asto Ching languages It was circulated that she cared almost nothing for money that she habitually turned down the salary raises due her to forestall a day when the school could not afford her and that she paid in stores by asking what amount was needed scrawling the sum into whatever counter checkbook the clerk happened to hand her and forgetting the matter forever In Valier this quick blink of a system worked well enough But in the countys main shopping town of Conrad it left a patter of misbanked checks bouncing behind her and her husband had at last to fund a bank account there solely to cover her offhand signatures As with finance she seemed to declare so with time and costume They meant no more to her than that she eventually had to appear somewhere with something on This brought Doig 248 about her fame for occasionally gardening with her nightgown on dark hair maned free and spilling to the waist and of I course her flowers and vegetables encouraged to ally into whatever clumps and jumbles they would At school she would arrive in dark plain dresses so alike that it could hardly be traced when she changed one for another bunned her hair into a great black burl at the back of her neck clopped from class to class in the severest of shoes She was buxom much like Grandma with a half more plumped on all around her mounding in front and behind was very nearly more than the lackadaisical dresses wanted to contain Leaning forward from the waist as she hurried about she flew among us like a schooners iusty figurehead prowing over a lazy sea The mind of Mrs Tidyrnan was somewhat like that ales garden of hersJsprigged here with theC1uu11I 1191iaala5she knew so entirely that she for A bedtime stories sprouting somewhere else with bouquets from Shakespeare twining now into a tale such as having seen the cowboy artist Charlie Russell when she attended the university in Missoula In the midst of a sorority tea someone deposited him with usdozens of fluffy gEls you n understand and he had been drinking for then the utmost indignitythey took his hat from him and he had nothing to do with his hands and sat helpless imprisoned Doig249 foliage of her learning laced everywhere through the school She taught all the English courses and Latin occasionally a course in Spanish directed the plays advised for the yearbook and newspaper and oversaw the library It could not be imagined where she might exist except in the midst of all this She had taken leave for enough years to have four sons and afterward decided the absence had been a mistake Chinese peasant women did it properly she reasoned giving birth to their babies in the fields and going right on with their toil That earliest watching I felt from this woman it turned out was to see whether I was a thief A few times a year a schoolwide set of vocabulary tests was given every student thenranked against national statistics The first testtime fell in the second week after I enrolled at Valier and I attacked with jovt if there was one knack in me it was to hold in mind any word I had ever seen much the way Dad could identify any sheep from all others When this first of the set of tests was scored no one among the seniors juniors or sophomores achieved better than a respectable 50 One of my classmates soared to a 60 well up in the national percentiles My paper lofted off to an unscorable 75 Before I had time to get the grin off my face Mrs Tidyman had asked me into the library locked the door and with as much tact as she could mustersomewhere close to noneDoig 250 wondered abruptly whether I had come across the answer sheet before the national test Whatever denial I stammered to herlwhat nightmare was this did I have to prove myself stupid before I would be trusted had a better one in the making All right There are three more tests in the next three days and I have the answer sheets secure Well just see howyou score on them Three times more I gapped everyone else in the school and shot out the top of all percentiles I didnt know whether to be triumphant or apprehensive but before I had much time for either Mrs Tidyman again was hauling me into the library clicking the lock eyeing me relentlessly You know you really to take my Latin class next year Latin will be an advantage for you in the use of And you should write for the school paper theres good practice And I want to know what you read I have a houseful of books if you cant find enough here I gulped the relief of being out from under Mrs Tidymans suspicion and sat back to see what the gale of her approval would bring In the classroom each hour with her began like a conjuring or a parody of one She would and back herself a high stool behind a 1 1 h ld 1 d ectern At ast secure in mi ir s e wou revo ve towar the class the entire billow of her far up over us with the lecterntop before her as if commanded to hover there Then Doig 21 her hand deep into her dress out of that vault of bosom would come eyeglasses tethered on a neck chain which still did not entirely stop her from losing them a few times each day a balled handkerchief a fountain pen likely leaking perhaps a fat ring of keys or a shredding blizzard of notes to herself Up would come her head from an unperturbed inventory of this rummage A mild glare or a stern look of fondness her shadings of expression could be baff lingJfastened onto the last of the class to go it might fall the entire total of her irony the query Do you mind if I begin now At last supplied and delivered she set at us The days assigned reading might be thumped open and launched into sheerly for the entrancement of hearing herself aloud rt was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness caoh people can you hear those phrases ring against one another If there was agony and tragedy so much the richer fancy As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport When I read the headline of an airplane crash people first I wish that no one I know was killed Then that no one from Montana was killed Then that no one from this cquntry Then that no one at all would have been killed04oh the lightning bolts which come down on us She would escort Richard Cory and Miniver Doig252 Cheevy to their poetic dooms one instant bring Ivanhoe galloping in to the bleats of chivalrys trumpets the next Now Lady Macbeth in gore now Portia pleading against blood In Latin class Mrs Tidyman never could have us read in Caesars Commentaries without declaiming on Caesar the man could not declaim on Caesar without sketching Roman society could not sketch the Romans without embracing all the Mediterranean on and on in a widening spiral of lore and enthusiasm glasses flying in her hand and bosom wheeling above the lectern like turrets searching for new fields of gunnery But it was the grammar of English that exalted her most Day after day we would troop to the blackboard to take apart sentences for her phrases chalked to one another like scaffolding being shown how a clause dovetailed here an infinitive did the splicing there the whole of it planed and beamed together as her pointer whapped through a reading of the revealed sentence For her the language held holy force and she shuddered at any squander of it In what must have been her fullest spate of forgiveness she once apologized about one of the townswomen Once you get used to split infinitives youll find shes a person And so Mrs Tidyman hovered at me from her heights of language declaiming diagramming rhapsodizing unabashedly giving favor to any of us who seemed rapt I was more than Doig 253 rapt held by her whirligig of language and learning as if I were a ball swung on a tether I bet she thinks she glommed onto something when you came to that school Grandma assessed after one of my reports about Mrs Tidyman Maybe I said as if I hadnt had the answer drilled into me by gray eyes Mrs Tidyman exhausting and exasperating and exhilarating was one education new to hand in our northern move Another introduced itself at the Jensen ranch on a weekend soon after we had moved in Two plump men presented themselves at the door and asked plees to see the chentleman of the ranch Both were bearded both wore black outer clothing over brilliant shirts and both stared as blinklessly into the kitchen as a pair of holidaying parsons who had lucked upon naked natives Grandma shooed them off toward the sheepshed to find Dad rammed the door shut and snicked a table knife into the ja Who in Christmas do you suppose them two are I had no supposing to offer they were as much apparition to me as to her But when Dad came in for coffee the pair clomped at his heels These fellows are Hoots he grinned Theyre our neighbors Beyond the second ridgeline to the south of us we discovered lay a ranch colony of a hundred such Hutterites a shy tranced people who gabbled among themselves in a German dialect and lived according to their signals from God Heaven told them an endless amount that we had Doig 254 never heard of such as that when one of their men married he had to grow whiskers along his jawline to make the circle which represented a wedding ring or that their women were proper only when swathed in long skirts aprons and kerchiefs like walking mounds of fresh we visited the colony to buy eggs or vegetablest1tthe parsonly pair had come by to invite us to do sowe also found that M the Hoots ran their ranch with a brisk orderliness which made the Jensen ranch seem even more woebegone Each family was allotted a set of rooms with gleaming board loors and stern furniture The small children waddled about like fat dolls in museum costqmes but the young men were hived off by themselves four to a room from their early teens until they married The young women rosecheeked mysteries inside their hoods and curtains of ginghamware stayed within the family until that marrying somehow managed to happen All the colony ate in a single great dining hall the men and boys first then the women and children after their superiors ftrode back to work Hierarchy it seemed was their second religion The Hoots doled work responsibilities as if they were the line officers of some farmerly regiment one man was appointed the Cow Boss another the Sheep Boss a third the Vegetable Boss on and on until every task was divvied out with its handle of duty and its claim on the colonys work force as needed Perhaps having eyed other Doig255 communal brethren toiling to stay with the old ways the Hoots also had made their decision about modern machinery they would use every roaring horsepower of it they could get their hands on The colony clattered with tractors throbbed with helpful engines A constant sight was a Hoot truckload of eggs speeding off to one town or another a gaggle of young men in the back like crows hitching a ride All in all the Hutterite system clicked out work like an assembly line The Dupuyer people said the Hoots could thrive a hundred at a time on land where an ordinary family had starved out They did not mean it as a compliment For the Hoots we learned had dark stains The first scandal always recited about them was that they did not believe in serving in the army Next that Hoot colonies didnt pay taxes like the rest of us because they were church organizations And beyond that in muskier tones their marrying habits The Hoots it seemed intermarried cousin to cousin until an entire colony might have only two or three surnames in it with the sinful clans further strung throughout colonies elsewhere in Montana and western Canada War money and sex whatever else you said of them the Hutterites did not skirt the big topics of life Dad with his penchant for hard cleanedged work liked the Hoots at once As often as he could arrange it some chore would Doig256 take him to the colony and the Sheep Boss would hail himl Vell Chollie Vot s your businesstiand escort him into the dining hall where one of the kerchiefed women brought him slices of bread or cake flat on the palm of her hand There also might be a snifter of the fine sweet rhubarb wine produced by the colony and manly grumbles with the Sheep Boss about the price of lambs and the prospects of grass Grandma was less enchanted the men ran the colony too rIhey parade around over there like they was eventually she too decided they were satisfactory neighbors Certainly they were hardworking and with her that nearly canceled out their quirks about soldiering and family line On the other hand she made a perplexity for the Hoot men when they came to visit Dad with her refusal to withdraw and leave the conversation to the males Her abrupt verdicts on the world were beyond their ken Ach vell perhaps Mizzus Ringer perhaps but yetLand our rankly household must have as mysterious Jo the Hutterites as their ordered family regiments were to usCffYet Dad evidently was a sensible enough soul on any topic except women and their nearest neighbor besides so the Sheep Boss and a crony or two continued to come by and confide to him their worries about the younger Hoots tender rabbits for the snares strewn by the modern world Television was the newest and seemed the most treacherous Harold Chadwick had sent off for a mail Doig257 order course scratched his chin briefly over the ream of diagrams then wired up a picture tube which now flickered and snapped in the Dupuyer service station day and night The elders recognized how spellbinding the fuzzed universe in the tube could belHoot youngsters were flocking in to ff gawk at Harolds miracle by the hour but were stymied about how they could battle it Still one to be done was to stay as unsurprised as possible about the outside worlds gray magic and the Sheep Boss showing how aweless he could be began to tell Dad about his wifes fright when she glimpsed Dupuyers startling television set Ho she tot the vorld was going straight tolhere he noticed Grandma as usual listening sharply and could not bring himself to say to hell in her presence Vas vas going down he finished desperately pushing his palms toward the brimfire below Grandma eyed him with fresh suspicion of Hoot backwardness She took a look at a television and thought she was FALLING Hmpf The Hutterites gave Grandma something to mutter about and she shortly solved for herself some of the ranchs yawning emptiness McGrath had left us with a bonus of his everlasting dog pack Behind the bunkhouse door one evening J a small several colored bitch apologetically gave birth The pups were only two but their mothers haphazard colors were passed on in fullest style One came out with a coat of sheening black icetipped at the tail and ruffed whiter Doig258 yet at his chest and neckithe other was a snowfield with thaws of tan the brockled markings romping up his sides and under his ears Grandma at once claimed them both pointing out to Dad that wed had enough of McGraths thuggish hounds and ought to train good sheep dogs of our own1rt was an argument he could not answer I suggested we call the newcomers McGrath and Jensen Grandma rapped out that she had never heard of such names for dogs no answer to that eitherJand dubbed A A then on these brothered dogs were to be the fourth and fifth members of our family and to bring us rewards and woes almost as major as those we brought on each other Both to Dads discomfort began to grow up with a stubbornness they seemed to imbibe straight from Grandma Spot winsome as his brockled coat proved to be tirelessly happy and helpful By every instinct in him he was a superb sheep dog eager farranging steady he had a sense of what he was about to be commanded to do and seemed to start his policing arc around a strayed ewe before your arm had quite come up to direct him Tip was as tireless but for him that same straying sheep clicked in his mind as a target of opportunity he was brain and fang a born biter Tip also was the fleetest dog any of us had ever seen his black body sleek and whetted as a racehorses the white peak of his tail streaking flat behind him like the flare of Doig 259 a rocket he constituted a lethal weapon Dad and Grandma at last harangued and cuffed Tip into a rough civility which put him in a mood of hurt astonishment that he should be veered from anything so natural as savaging a ewe But for all efforts sending Tip far around the sheep always remained chancy like targetpracticing near an amrnuni tion dump and the sheep learned to shy and stampede into retreat at the farthest sight of the black fury4spot watched his brother with curiosityhe knew just as deeply in his instincts that I the sheep were never to be bittenand loped his routes around the a guiding angel But Spot too had the streak of insistence in him his lust was for appreciation From Grandma he had reward in plenty endless pettings and talkingsto and the freedom of the house From Dad quickly ablaze with having been jumped on fondly by Spot for the twentieth time in a day or having tripped across his doorway sprawl for the fortieth he could not count on such affection and it would seem to puzzle him briefly his tongue out a corner of his mouth as he watched Dads thwarting back Then with a thankful look around the room Spot would plop in the doorway again and wait for his next shift with the beloved sheep Dad and I thought we had become used to a life full of dogs when Grandma suddenly filled it more from another direction From somewhere she now came up with a cat a selfsufficient young gray tiger which she advice asked or offered Doig 260 this time Kitten All right Lady Dad decreed watching 11 Kitten purr across his shins thatll be just about enough In this first halfyear of our new northern life some surprises began to be shown by the Jensen ranch itself basic and stark and drowsing as it seemed The first was that the place had clay bogholes hidden like elephant traps in its grass After a few plunges into those wallows and his cursing hikes to the Hoots for a tow Dad traded the pickup in favor of a metal cabbed Jeep The next startlement came at lambing time when snow clung and clung to the benchland slopes and the grass refused to green Without the fresh grass the ewes milk was weak and their lambs came down with diarrhea The pile of tinAtcarcasses outside the great shed began to grow by the hourjfpamnitall tohell these lambs are all gonna drizzle themselves to death if we dont do something Dad hurried a call to a veterinarian and what we were to do was to spoon cod liver oil for its vitamin D content into every lawb 41 Across a nightmare for the crisiswe lt set of daysI staved home from school penned and caught and spoonfed each of the two thousand lambs They survived but we nearly didnt thumbs aching from having forced two thousand stubborn mouths open for the medicine backs bowed from two thousand reachings and liftings As we grayly ate supper after the last handling of the last lamb Grandma Doig 261 not even could sideways outfit this is f the grass wants to grow like it should But there was pasture grass to come months pilling with grass as if a fifth season had been tanly matted into the middle of the year Dads decision to come north with McGrath had been keyed to thisJthe summer pasture for C t lllE sheep on the prairie of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation north of Dupuyer They say that Reservation is a bunchgrass country you can hardly believe If I cant bring fat lambs in from grass like that Ive had my head off my shoulders for forty years The Jensen ranch was leased for only eight months of the year from June through October the grass months which would fatten the lambs for shipping Dad and Grandma and I would graze the sheep on a pasture allotment on the Reservation We were about to see the prairie face of our northern life When the sheeps hooves hit the edge of the ranch on the last morning of into three desperate days of trudging yelling dogging cursing fretting Our Reservation range lay forty highway miles north from Dupuyer and every step of it threatened to joggle loose the dim panic at the center of each sheeps brain Pushing the skittery thousands of animals up the strange dike of pavement became a guerrilla struggle against every yapping farmyard dog any blowing bit of paperand worse each and every auto that came along like a hippopotamus nosing among Doig 262 penguins 41 Grandma would be seething against the motorists within the first God darn them dont they have enough brains to even take themselves through a band of sheep Tourists stopping innocently in the middle of the band to ask why the lead sheep had a bell on and all the others didnt would find themselves fiercely invited to git on through the sheep here how would y ou like it if I laid our front yard and started asking you questions were to live for the summer in a muchtraveled small trailer house which McGrath had flimflarruned from somewhere Dad had it in tow behind the JeepMKitten an indignant yowling passenger insideand roved nervously with this wornlooking convoy in the wake of the sheep jumping out to whoop stragglers down the highway and hustling around to catch any exhausted lambs which needed to be ferried in the Jeep for a time I did whatever he couldnt getfto and as well paftted off in endless jogs around the sheep to flag down cars in blind spots on the roadclr had made each for Grandma and for myself a noisemaker calleda tin dogMa ring of baling wire with half a dozen empty evaporated milk cans threaded on so that it could be shaken tambourinelike into a clattering din Mile upon mile with our ruckus behind them the dubious ewes and their panicky lambs edged north Doig 263 Water decreed each days push of the sheep From the Jensen ranch we had to make the 16 miles north to Birch Creek the first night in order to bed the tired band where they could graze and drink It meant funneling the sheep through Dupuyer at the Chadwicks and other townfolk stepping out to give us a hand as the woolly sea of backs shied from gas pumps and parked cars and the thin neck of bridge across Dupuyer Creek pushing on across a broad chocolateandgold bench of farmland and then into the long tight trench of ttnced lane a full afternoon of battling traffic and timejfThe only ones happy with the summer trail were Tip who saw it as a feast of sly nips among the sheep and Spot who adoringly would begin to herd half the band up the highway by himself and to loll tonguey grins at us for appreciation The pair of them had their grandest moment of the year here where the sheep had to be shoved like a vast ball of wool into the neck of a bottle Time after time an exasperated ewe would prance out and like a knights charger for a single haughty instant stamp a front hoof at the dogs in challenge Then it dawning on her that she was entirely helpless against the knifetoothed pair she would wnirl and waddle in panicked retreat One of my chores was to try to keep Tip from tearing these bold ninnies to ribbons and he regarded me with his puzzled hurt whenever Doig264 I him back in time At last after hours of working the tin dogs and the real dogs and ourselvesby sunset if we had been luckythe sheep would spill off the highway to the graveled banks of Birch Creek The second day the same straining push to water this time a dozen highway miles to Badger Creek In places the road now whipped into sudden curves and I would spend most of this day flagging the coming cars in front of the sheep We were on the Blackfeet Reservation now and I passed my time between baffled tourists by wondering what our life here would be like All I knew of Indians was that carloads of them whirled into Dupuyer most nights of the week They had come for beer would drink it in their cars then drive off again in a lurching stutter of traffic Every few weeks there would be slaughter a beery crashing off a highway curve and the limp bodies catapulted against cutbanks and along the barrow pit The state highway department sternly put up a white cross wherever an auto victim died and some curves on the highway here north were beginning to look like little country graveyards And I had read avidly what a Reservation correspondent named Weasel Necklace wrote in one of the regions weekly newspapers about the doings of his tribesmen Some of the people went to Conrad to do some shopping and they all managed to come Doig265 back through Dupuyer From there they came home fighting and singing Jesse Black Man was picked up at a ranch last week disturbing a home And when police found him he was in a hay stack with just his head covered Something wrong Head Carrier has been staying home he wont go to town He does wrong when in town and now has started to go wrong here The Blackfeet seemed to be a rambunctious people I wondered what they thought of our white faces and gray sheep against the backcloth of their prairie past As we passed the accident crosses nearer and nearer to our Reservation lease like silvered warnings along a route of pilgrimage the landscape emptied and emptied until there was no hint of flowing water or tree cover Then sometime beyond noon on the third day a sudden trench of both the Two Medicine a middling greenbanked river which somehow had found itself a gorge worthy of a cataract We came behind the sheep down a long sharp skid of slope looking below to high clumps of cottonwoods on the river bank a few tribal houses even what seemed to be an entire tiny ranch or two Lazing east the Two Medicine wound out of sight beneath a cliff face which banked a hundred old and We feet high like a very were told later that the site had been a buffalo jump where the horseback Doig266 Blackfeet stampeded the animals over the edge to death 41Then the final bridge of our route across the mild flow of river and the highway ranping up the facing canyon slope The Two Medicine carved the southern boundary of our summer geography our lease rimming off there at the fortress cliffs And so late in the third daY1 the sheep at last fan onto the suwmer pasture We call in the disappointed dogs and let the band ease graze rest Now for the next hundred days and more the slow munch of the ewes and lambs across the ridges will be our pace of life A new country again this Reservation land lay like long tan islands in a horizonbrimming tan ocean Westward the Rockies jagged up as if they were the farthest rough edge of the world but the other three directions flung themselves flat to grass grass and grass Eastering ridgelines such as the one we would live along ran from the base of the mountains tawny as lions backs and crouched forward a b it toward the regions draining r ivers the Two Medicine in its plummet of gorge to our south and the Mariasta name I would hold on my tongue half the surnmerl1 beyond sight to th e e ast Open and overawing as it was this tense pulled taut and inward with its summer I contradictions All this flatness and yet some p urposeful tilts to it Doig 267 our own ridge dropping after any few paces southward slanting off to a sharp coulee which pitched deeper and darker the single cut of line anywhere on the prairie until it shot like a flume through the base of the cliffs above the Two Medicine The sun wheeling so hot above the plain that sweat cooked from you even as you stood yet on the crownline of the mountain horizon there might be whitegray snow clouds coldly billowing A landscape which seemed to have nearly no water and of water plentiful but unseenJfor across our entire empire of pasture there was a single tiny spurt of fresh water for us at a trickling spring near the ridge base and for the sheep dreg pools from the melt of winters snowdrifts hidden in the bowl bottoms between every ridgelinelfThen the contradiction tJ answered my wondering about what it would be like living among the Blackfeet We were amid them all right in the heart of the prairie which they had roved and ruled for generations and there was to be scarely an Indian in sightJnor anyone else inhabitant or travelerfon our allotted grassland across the entire summer That left the question of how the three of us would live with ourselves Almost before we had fanned the sheep onto the new grass of the Reservation and could begin to find out McGrath arrived with another of his sudden projects He had a contract to build several miles Doig 268 of fence on a ranch west of Great Falls and MickeyandRudy were at some other chore for him He wanted Dad from him4rt would be quick money to subcontract the fencing which we could use Dad could easily finish the job in a few weeks Dad turned to Grandma and me Can you pair handle these sheep for that time Not at all sure we could we both echoed that we supposed so Dad drove off with McGrath Grandma and I stared down from the ridge to the four thousand grazing animals which now were our responsibility When we went down to take a closer look we found that not all of them were grazing A few were on their sides legs stiff in the air dead as stones We looked at them in bafflement they were some of the plumpest best ewes in the entire band the kind Dad called dandiest Poison There were no whi tegreen blossoms of death camas in sight and neither Grandma nor I could think of any other threat Queasily I snicked open my pocket knife I had watched Dad skin the pelts from carcasses before but never had done it myself By the time I had sliced and ripped the pelts from the dead sheep Grandma was puffing back from a look at the far side of the band Gee gods theres another one dead over there I seen the trouble Theyre getting themselves down to scratch It dawned what this treeless flowing grassland Doig 268 of fence on a ranch west of Great Falls and MickeyandRudy were at some other chore for him He wanted Dad from would be quick money to subcontract the fencing which we could use Dad could easily finish the job in a few weeks Dad turned to Grandma and me Can you pair handle these sheep for that

Grandma was puffing back from a look at the far side of the band Gee gods theres another one dead over there I seen the trouble Theyre getting themselves down to scratch It dawned what this treeless flowing grassland Doig 269 meant to us just then There was not one upright particle on all these miles of range for a sheep to rub against and an attack of ticks was beginning to make the ewes itch beneath their heavy fleeces Of course it had been one of McGraths economies that the sheep hadnt been sprayed for ticks as they were at the Camas Aw hell in this country I dont think ticks will amount to anythin Now the sheep were rolling themselves on the ground to scratchLa roll Thich easily carried them too far onto their deepwooled backs to be able to get up again and within minutes in the summer heat their struggling would bloat them to death We had the prospect ballooned corpses around usff r choked to of endless Grandma What the hell are we gonna do She snapped I dont like to hear you say hell Then Were gonna have to stay right b with the sheep and turn em off their dblasted backs We spent every daylight hour of the next fourteen days patrolling the sheep When we spotted the telltale kick of hooves in the air I would run to the ewe grab deep into her fleece and heave her overrshe would wobble off lopsidedly bulging with thefiloat gas built up in her but alive Grandma used Spot and Tip A ewes redoubled panic as she looked along the ground and saw those eager jaws bulleting for her usually was enough to thrash her onto her feet Doig270 But we could not be everywhere every moment and so we lost sheep to themselvesone sometimes two a day which I would skin out bitterly and carry the spongy pelt back to camp We had lost bout twenty when McGrath and Dad drove in one was furious at the sight of the stack of pelts each of them a few cents remainder from one of his highpriced ewes He found he was less furious than who scorched him up down and crosswise for not having sprayed the sheep for ticks qlnad let it go on for a while ifit was not of ten a person got to see McGrath take a torching of this sortand at last broke in All right all right this isnt helping a thing Lets get matters going again why dont we First thing Mac will you watch the sheep a couple hours while we go into town for grub Ladys gonna have to do a helluva shopping by now McGrath saw no way to refuse and Grandma and I sulked into the Jeep with Dad On the way into Browning we defended ourselves endlessly until Dad at last settled us down by pointing out that the fencing money already was bolstering our bank account and that most of the loss of the ewes would come out of McGraths end of the shares arrangement I know you did your level best with the sheep Id trust the both of you with em again in a minute Grandma and I were improved by the time we drove back Doig271 from Browning We improved more when the Jeep growled down to the sheep and we spotted McGrath He was up to his elbows in skinning a dead ewe Unable to range fast and far enough on those brief bowsd legs of his he had lost three sheep on their backs while we were gone A truce never broken came down over all mention of our stint of herding alone With Dad back onthe scene we settled into our slow summer the trailer house towed back and forth along the ridge summit each week or so like a silver turtle creeping the horizon the sheep nuzzling east or west on the prairie below as the grass led them Separately the lives of the three of us by now had touched down in dozens of random sites but nothing out of the past of any one of us for this flood of prairie items earth to navigate over and the bunchgrass sprouting like countless elfin quivers of arrows to nourish the sheep All else of life had to be first could be foundlflEvery secon we bouncecl down the ridge in the Jeep to fill our water cans at the tiny trickle of a spring and perhaps to have a swimming bath r in the mudbanked reservoir below the spring Fire I fuel was scarcer than water Not a twig of wood grew anywhere within sight and we had to rove like horse Doig 272 thieves to find a collapsed shed or a driftwood pile along the Two Medicine There was a mockery here because as we explored off across the empty spans of prairie we again and again came across what seemed the eeriest of abundances seagull flocks Grandma and I had never seen them before but Dad recognized their white soaring from his winter on the Pacific Coast Must be in here feedin on grasshoppers Grandma however noted only that the gulls would scavenge a sheep carcass as avidly as magpies and at once adopted them as the same sort of nemesis She dubbed them sharks and the Reservation ridgelines began to ring with Git GIT you gosh darn sharks nothin dead around here for you goodfornothings Our source of groceries was the Reservation headquarters town of Browning some ten miles to the northwest Going in for supplies once a week broke our monotony on the herding range but replaced it with sour notions of the Reservation people Whatever time of day we drove in Browning always seemed a stunned place snuffling in the dust from its chuckholed streets and bleary from booze own4The towns remnant of the Blackfeet nation seemed even more or boredom or some worse affliction all its mauled than those who frequented Dupuyersquinty colored people men with black braids dropping tiredly from under their cowboy hats women so fat they seemed Doig 273 to waddle even standing still These people dipped and veered along the sidewalks entire families drunk by mi out ay cars the windows away with bodies spilled half was explainable enough anyone who was industrious was out of sight somewhere earning a living and to judge a people entirely by the Browning street scenes was as blinkered as walking into the nonIndian saloon crowds on a Saturday night in White Sulphur Springs or Dupuyer and declaring that no white person in the county could be capable of drawing a sober breath Yet we did judge that way and hard When we met an Indian rancher at the eastern boundary of our lease land who was diligent and prosperous Dad said Well they can do some work if they want to I guess But most of them Browning bozoes ought to sign on for lessons from the Hoots Since the Blackfeet never appeared out on their own landscape we took advantage of the emptiness to become steady poachers letting the pothole lakes feed us fresh meat Ducks and geese dabbled there all summer long and our 22 rifle made a soft quicklygone whinng which couldnt be heard beyond the ridges Dad and I had sharpshooting contests trying to snick off the ducks heads without touching the body meat Spot forever ready for trouble or help instantly learned to retrieve Grandma whooped Doig 274 orders and scoldings at him until he would deposit the birds to her gently as a feathery bouquet Life inside the trailer house was as cramped as life outside was unbounded Our entire space was about twenty feet long and seven feet wideJDad J j and I shared the bunk which went across one end Grandma made her bed on the padded bench which douned as seating along one side of the table Between the beds was walled a welter of tiny drawers cabinets closets a cookstove and the breadbox sized battery radio on which Grandma listened to her soap operas in the mornings and Dad and I listened to the baseball broadcasts while the sheep were shaded down at middaycff The suns heat hit the roof of the trailer and went bowling off in dizzy wavers but even so the central part of the day inside our quarters was like being in a lidded stewpot Time stretched and sagged The dogs abandoned d 1 d d d If h f h d us an went to ay roope an patnting in t e square o s a e beneath the Jeep When we werent trying to doze through the hot hours Dad and I read Grandma either played solitaire orcrocheted periodically straightening her glasses in disgust and giving her commentary that Wouldnt you just know this thread keeps tangling itself six ways from Sunday The one among us truly at ease with the drifting prairie life was Kitten who instantly discovered himself to be a long0grass hunter We would catch Doig275 glimpses of him padding off through the ridgeline s srQetop high veldt an intent tiger the size and shade of a jackrabbit To Grandmas agitation Kitten always was away on a hunt whenever we moved the trailer house to a new site each cJ time she would storm fretfully about his absence each time Dad would declare as if he knew everything about cats Hell turn up when he gets his fill of prowlin and each time that night or the next morning Kitten would come purring in along the wheel tracks on the grass and leap casually into Grandmas lap But for the three of us cooped in the trailer house northland7Lmockery againJseemed to be tightening and tightening our lives The first weeks of July came and the ewes were sheared by a Mexican crew who put up a canvas town amid the tan grass for two days and then vanished The prairie hung even musical j The lands tautness grew nd grew A into us until an afternoon in midsummer when Dad got up from lunch to go look at the asked if I wanted to ride along My nose sighted into a book I said my usual No not unless you need me I recognize now that he did need me in a way neither of us could have put to words then but he said only no hed go alone be back soon 4 He came in the door an hour later pale and pawing his chin nervously Whats got into you Grandma demanded Doig 276 hell he breathed I just almost shot a man When he climbed into the Jeep to go Dad as usual had taken his 3030 hunting rifle with him We had been warned in Browning that a dog pack was savaging sheep in the area and I want to be able to cut down on the bastards if they get into ours What caught his eye from the topmost lift of the ridgeline however was not a few dogs but an entire band of sheep like a giant wedge aimed on a long ripping route all the way across our range A band on the move of course was allowed to cross a persons range7vra necessary code of the countrytbut these sheep were broadly flung and grazing not being driven It would take them three days to cross at their pace and in that time they would scythe out our summers best grass Dad drove down to the munching band and pulled up near the herder and his dogs I said to old mister herder these sheep are eatin my prime range here suppose you can swing em nearer those north ridges and clear em out of here by tonight Big strappin sonofabuck he looks at me and says I got a right to trail these sheep through here I always have I says Then why dont you trail em Then he started cussin and came right for me He was set to drag me out and give me a good goin over he was Startled his hands still innocently on top of the steering wheel Dad kicked the Jeep door open to show the 3030 cradled across his lap That slowed the honyocker up some you can just Doig 277 bet He took a good look and backed off and put those dogs on the sheep and didnt stop until he was off our grass But if hed kept comin at me there Id of had to pull the trigger on him That day sobered us1Dad shoot someone The deathly clap of the shatter the prairie silence blood spurt onto our lease grassas if we had been slapped from a trance After that I rode with Dad whenever he drove out to check on the sheep Not the least of the lesson from the faceoff was that if I had been with him instead of burrowed into a book the two of us could have the charging herder without a rifle coming into itJTGrandma was subdued on guard against herself from saying anything rilesome Instead one morning she came out with I just been thinking I could take a turn looking at the sheep if I could drive the Jeep Suppose you can learn me Apron flapping this woman who had teamstered horses in weather and terrain most people wouldnt set foot into now strode out with Dad and me and settled nervously behind the first steering wheel of her life Although she never would venture onto a road or be talked into trying for a drivers licenseLIm scared of that written partJthe Reservations expanses after this regularly heard the sound of her grinding the Jeep along in low gear bonused with the beep of surprise as she brushed against the horn button every so often Doig 278 Dad made his own conciliation He suggested that Grandma and I make a visit to White Sulphur Springs for a week I know you want to see ymr family there Lady you deserve to and Ill be all right alone here Ill see theres no more funny business like that rifle affair The two of you go We did go did our visiting The Smith River Valley seemed to me to lay beneath narrower castled horizons now Where was the expanse the sense of living at the ridgeline of the entire continent in any of this Yet where in our summer trailer or in the Jensen house was any of the knit of the past which each of usJand Grandma most of all still could feel from the valleytf I drove us north again wondering to myself how we were going to fend If I wanted to look at our situation in its coldest being a worrying youngster I didLthe three of us added up to a I makeshift family who lived in half a house for of a year and then off onto the prairie to exist more oddly yet It was nothing to recrnnmend to the rest of society But say this for ourselves we still were together after nearly four years of grimly cobbled truces between Dad and Grandma And I found as I mulled it that a knack for cobbling was not a small thing from this thintempered pair I had another fret when we were back with Dad on the A ridgeline and I rode with him to look at the sheep These Doig 279 lambs just dont look as big to me as the ones were at the Camas Dad had a grinning answer for that Theyre not But theyre heavier The grass is so crisp up here it packs a hard fat on em They wont be like the ones in the Smith River like all hell when we ship em On the late September weekend when we chuted the lambs into stock cars at a railroad siding north of our range their poundage made it a festivity smile as he penciled the profit figure Spot as a virtuoso among sheepdogs Even Tip cruising along the outside of the shipping pens to grab bites of sheep whenever he saw the chance seemed surprised to look up once and find his brother bounding crammed knot of ewes to get to his atop the backs of a pos next A had heard that highest phrase of praise a dog thatll run on wool but never had seen it done until Spot performed A railroad worker asked Dad who had trained the whi teandbrown dog Mv motherinlaw right there Dad said with his admitting grin Shes got him so hell do everything but dance the schottische Grandma answered with a deeply pleasel hmpf September also meant that I had to come off the Reservation for my second year at Valier now with the notion beginning in me that I had better become more purposeful about what Doig 280 I studied This did nothing to cure me of randomly reading whatever print I could lay my hands on over the delusion that I ever was going player I didnt even have a right knee that worked properly although the doctor said I was in the last year of having to wrap the daily elastic pressure onto itwhen I tried to think of other choices of life ahead ranching held itself up first By now I knew much about livestock especially sheepraising and Dad could teach me endlessly more If that was where life was pointing with this fresh start in the north our family chance at last to count up to the profits that would lead to the buy of a ranch there might be a logic behind it I enrolled for the high schools vocational agriculture class But I also chose Mrs Tidymans Latin class and found I was at least as interested r in the textbook version of Caesars farmers16Galba agricola estLas I was in voags mechanized version The school had a new superintendent now a silent largeheaded man who seemed to have to spend his full time trying to look dignified The effort went to doom at once when someone learned that his middle name was Eldo As far as I could tell in the rest of my high school days he showed never an idea about education except to patrol around it with mocking off his measured footsteps But I see now that his ambling swoom may have been lucky Doig281 for any of us trying to learn ignoring as it did whatever useful that Mrs Tidyman and one or two others of the teachers resorted to in the classroomlfBy second luck I had arrived at Valier into an unusually selfsteadying group of classmates High school often is written of as a torchlit raucous time when friendships and enmities sear deepest Perhaps because I had so much blaze elsewhere in my life my high school class seems to me now as then a regiment of dozen girls and ten boys ours was the most equable population I had ever belonged Tidyman could give out more uproar reading a paragraph of Dickens than the bunch of us might in a week No one was particularly prettier or handsomer than those in the classes which had gone through before us nor I think any more winsome or wicked but several of us were more persevering than was usual and a surprising number had more cleverness I found after Mrs Tidymans keelhauling examination of me when I first arrived that I got along easily at the school Clearly I was an odd commodity my mind did tricks nobody elses did nor did anyone else come out of anything like my sheep cafe jumble of iYt tJS t the other boys quite as stoic It backdrop nor 1 I as I seemed about the subject of gir none of these classmates seemed more than bemused by any of it And I did contribute the point of pride that in those exams I could be counted on to won i i W for us I went through the school year then to three steady pulses days at classes in Valier nights at the Chadwicks weekends once did on the Jensen ranch with Dad and Grandma this to fly apart I Just In early December out of nowher Grandma announced to us that she was going to spend Christmas with her sister in had not been at the ranch while that decision brewed but knew that there was little holiday flavor to it Shell get it out of her system this way Dad said and maybe then And maybe then come back and tell us the trip had been s iarifying that she was going f to keep on right out of our lives yes I could see all J the and maybe then What the episode was all about I never knew nor did Dad seem to have any notion Perhaps my grandmother simply reached a point where she had to make some test on life for herself and certainly her turn was long overdue We said an apprehensive goodbye to her at the bus station in Great Falls She gave us a frosty farewell and marched aboard I had no idea how the ranch household could run without her To my surprise Dad housekept diligently He cooked as heartily as she hadir had forgotten his stint in the Doig 283 White Sulphur we lived in high style on venison steak and the rich milk gravy he made from the fry grease to laier over discs of fried potatoes But the house echoed empty enough to boom lessons into us and Christmas spluttered in and away as a wan day we were glad to see end When Grandma arrived back in her promised two weeks cheerful and full of scorn for WisconsinGee I forgot how dampish the winters come back thereLwe were overfed and entirely eager to have her with us again The winter went in truce then it was the lambing season again the moment for another of the Jensen ranchs routine sprin0time calamities to conk us A mid 1ay u blizzard hit and in a day and a night sealed the ranch in fat heavy snowdrifts The Hoots came crashing across the benchland with a giant bulldozer and punched our way to the stranded bunches of sheep We had some loss but not nearly what it might have been and at the start of summer we pushed the sheep north to the Reservation with the thought in our minds that this years worst lay behind us But as soon as the Mexican crew finished shearing the sheep in the first few days of July worry and edginess set in on Dad The weather had an unaccountable chillMGee gods is it gonna snow on us for the Fourth of July Grandma demanded of the skyand with our shorn ewes we Doig 284 had on our hands a double thousand of the worlds most undressed creatures caught in only their paunchy yellow white carcasses like hospital invalids with their gowns suddenly ripped away Within a week the sheep would be gray and hardy again their next fat round sponge of fleece already beginning to cloak them But for these first days they stood naked helpless to a storm And dragging across the of the Rockies black clouds somehow sprung ahead from cold late autumn into July were beginning to fray into rain Early on the second morning after shearing Dad came back to the trailer house gnawing his lower lip He had not the sheep out of the temporary corral where we were penning them these first uncomfortable nights The was that the band could panic in the corral and crush onto one another in suicidal pileitfor certain in a cold driving rain hundreds of trapped ewes would destroy themselves and their lambs that way But the second worst threat was for a storm to maul into sheep loose for stampede on this unsheltered range and this was the risk the swollen clouds were forcing on us nowIThat weathers comin in sure as hell Were gonna have to hightail it for the brush on Two Medicine with these sheep Lady youll have to work the dogs dog the bejesus out of em Ivan can run he can get on the head end of the band and try push em toward that big coulee Ill take the Jeep to round in the breakaways The first blast of wind swayed the trailer We piled out Doig 285 the doorway into the longest hours of our lives Before we could reach the corral a sharp rain began to sting down The mountains had vanished and the gray which blotted them already was taking the ridgeline Chill sifted into the air as the rain drilled through Now a wind steadily sharpening the storms attack The sheep milled in the corral as if being stirred by I that held it the gate bowed snapped apartHgainst I the tonnage of the of struggling bodies shapes of the ewes rivered past us slapped and spun us Lambs dashed at their mothers heels in blatting bewilderment Shoo em Spot Grandma was shrilling Way round em there Bite em good Tip God darn their crazy hides I ran the first sprint of endless running crying Hyaw Hyaw as I tried to head the leaders I heard the Jeep gunning as Dad set out after another runaway group What we faced if we could not bring the band under control was a rapid steady push toward the devastation of our sheep The rain was pelting out of the north As it spun the cold terrified sheep straight south before it they were aimed like an avalanche to the cliffs which bladed up from the gorge of the Two Medicine Countless of them could crash off there as the buffalo had in their fearblind rush from the whooping Blackfeet our animals were being driven on to death which could not be stilled One way alone offered any chance to get the sheep down to the shelter of the river brush try to funnel them along the bottom of the single big coulee which dived like a long trench across our range and out through the western base of the Two Medicine rimrocks But to do it we would have to fight the sheep west into the cleft of coulee sideways along the punishing storm And so we fought running raging hurling the dogs and ourselves at the waves of sheep flogging with the gunny sacks we had grabbed off a corral post shaking the wire rings of cans to a din and steadily as the rain shot down on us we lost ground We were like skirmishers against a running armgmight bend the band slightly and gradually toward the coulee but all the while their circling panic was carrying toward the cliffs now not more than a few thousand yards away Only several minutes away for sheep running headlong It was not yet mid ay and grayness had clamped in on the ridgeline over us as if to rain for the rest of time We could do nothing right in the curtaining rain I hurled my ring of cans to head off a breakaway ewe and the wire circle feel over her neck and sent her clattering crazily across the prairie at twice the speed howl of Doig 287 Minutes later I tossed a rock as I had a thousand times to scare another ewe back into the band The wet stone slipped in my hand wobbled straight for the ewe and hit her exactly at the joint of the hind leg Broken leg flapping as she struggled at the rear of the band she haunted me everlastingly that day I threw nothing more tried and failed to make up for it with runs to turn the to a croak I saw Jeep to that Dad sat blinking the I for a minute to collect himself Now slowly wearily some of the sheep began to stop running They sank to the ground to die Nothing could move them1kicking lifting even Tips attacks Exhausted and freezing they jutted their necks flat along the ground their eyes and did their dyingJ we abandoned these stragglers humped prairie behind us like small boulders left white on the by a glacier and fought on with the sheep still eddying across the grassland4Then for minutes the rain eased left a sensation of acute tingling emptiness as in a blackened snagland after crownfire has hurtled through Then Dad was roaring Give em hell now Grandma charged the southmost bulge of the sheep with the dogs and Dad jounced the Jeep horn button mashed down in a steady blare into the head of the band where I was whooping myself Doig 288 hoarse We ramrned the animals a few hundred yards westward close now to where the coulee shadowed darkest on the darkened achieved the last atom of push for us there is no knowingffperhaps some instant of Spots savvy or Tips savagery perhaps a whip of wind momentarily lashing around in our favor instead of against us Perhaps only the force field of our desperation Whatever levered them the last inches to the west a trickling few sheep at the front of the sodden swirl at last were dodging into the coulee and the main mass pressing blindly after them It cost us the rear hundreds of the band When the rain bulleted harder again a frenzied surge of them broke sideways around the dogs and spilled away from us like wheat out of a tipped sack The rest of the sheep we held barely at the ground we had gained and watched the breakaways scuttle across the rainbeaten grass toward the cliffs Now the battle in the coulee became one both to hurry and to hold back The sheep trying to plunge ahead of the rains flay still could pile themselves to destruction in the veers of the coulees banked sides and had to be headed beaten to a slower pace the ones beginning to give up and drop had to be savaged into moving on Dad abandoned the Jeep came leaping down the coulee flank to join Grandma and me The long white vee of sheep accordioned wildly down the coulee as we pushed and held Doig289 held and of the three of us said a word now our voices long since given out If the dogs yet barked as they knifed back and forth along the band we did not notice Silently Dad and Grandma and I flogged sheep with the damp gunnysacks as if they were a stubborn wall of flame and watched for the mouth of the coulee to inch out of the rain toward us We reached it in and the sheep spewed down beneath the juts of cliff to the rivers sheltering brim of willows and cottonwoods In a dozen hours we had managed to flog 3500 desperate sheep a little more than four miles A hundred or more carcasses spotted the prairie behind us dozens more strewed the base of the cliffs which the runaway clump had avalanched toward If this was victory Land we had to tell ourselves it was for we could have lost nearly all the sheep in a pushing massacre off the Two Medicine cliffsLr knew I wanted no part of any worse day I remember that I looked back from the mouth of the coulee toward the dusky north ridges still smoked with of the storm As much as atJlny one instant in my life I can say here I was turnedffHow long such a moment had been in the making I am the last to judge because once made it seemed to have begun farther back than I could remember and yet to have happened like an Doig290 eyeblink Two decades later readying to write about a man who had recently retired after decades of fame as a forestry scientist I asked him in midinterview how he had found his way into his career Until then he had been detail but here he hesitated no more words than this he told me of simply deciding one afternoon when he was a schoolboy plowing in his fathers field in Indiana that he would go off as soon as he could and become a chemist Helpless to find any deeper decision back inside he sat back with both plea and challenge in his face1113ut any questioning was gone from me lost in the recognition that I had just heard so close a chord with my own unwordable instant As soon as I could manage to do so after that July storm over Grandmas dismayed protest and Dads unspoken one I left the Reservation to find myself a job for the rest of the sunuuerpiling bales in the hayfields of a ranch south of Dupuyer I had no steady idea ef about what I would do in life but I intended now that it would not include more seasons of sheep on that vast gambling table of Blackfeet rangeland It startles me yet that I was the first even as mildly and temporarily as I went about it to declare my way out of our edgy alliance of a household Dad nearly achieved it before I for the mauling the sheep had taken left Doig291 its toll on him too1 what had been a year of certain l profit now was going to be time of eking by of hard and skillful work drawing small wage Before I could leave for my hayfield job a noontime spat built and built between Grandma and him like the clouds boiling again on the of the Rockies At last he announced The hell with ye Im going into Browning She said in ice Go drinking beer I suppose Youre damn right he said in fire and flung off over the ridgeline in the Jeep He was gone for the day and then the night When he came back the next noon the extent of his plunge stunned us all and we passed around it with as little said as possible Erupting loose that way from whatever it was that held us together was not a tning we dared look at too closely for within the past half year each one the three of us now had shown some such urge off for the next several weeks across some boundary best known to my sixteenyearold self When I went from the Reservation that midsummer to my first work as a hired hand in effect I stepped across time to Dads life at the same age going off to try to earn from the very surroundings which had been so stingy to the larger household But where under him the broad muscles of horses had rippled and become a way of life beneath me machinery throbbed In the hot weather of that Doig 292 year and the next ones to come I learned to keep the pace of piling eightypound hay bales all day long onto a moving truck of cocooning inside the roar and dust of tractors crawling across wheat fields of steadying a grain truck beside a lurching combine to catch the harvested flow of gold The north country opened and beckoned for me as the sage distances of the valley must have for Dad at my age Clock hours changed stretched in that summer light lunch happened whenever food arrived in the field to be eaten gratefully in the shaded dust beneath a tractor or truck supper came into the when at last it was too dark to do anything else The Reservations glacier of slow weeks was left to Dad and Grandma now to fend with that and themselves however they could In another of the unspoken but obstinate bargains our household ran on I would help with the trailing of the sheep at the start of each summer and with the first week or so of settling into the routine of the ridgelinJ but then I would go I could be expected to visit whenever I had a rare Sunday off from work but all the other days of my summers were my own nowkand I meant them to run full and swift I learned rapidly that I either had luck or had to make it My second summer of hiring out I heard of a job on a ranch somewhere far to the north of the Reservation near a point on the Canadian boundary called Whiskey Gap Doig293 I asked Dad for the loan of the old Dodge car we had acquired and set off fighting roads and taking directions at any house I sawkfew of at last fifty miles beyond Browning and within a glance of the Canadian border I found the ranch Dusk was going to dark and no one answered my knock I stepped out of my muddy shoes on the porch walked in and went to sleep on the couch in the living room In a few hours when the rancher came home and snapped on the light his wife largeeyed behind him I said my name and Dads and asked if I could have the job Apparently as a reward for having found the place at a1 r could l The job was to drive a grain truck and exactly at an impatient time in my growing up it fed me all the velocity and I could ask for The ranchers grown son a lanky grinning man named Ron drove one elderly red truck I drove its mate By gunning along the narrow graveled dike of road as fast as we dared we could make one haul to the grain elevator at Cut Bank in the morning and another in the afternoon There was a very long breakneck hill in the middle of the run which Ron and I traded jokes about I had the world moving on my last load he would drawl By the time I hit the bottom of that sonofabitch hill I must have been going a thousand miles an hour Near the end of the summer I was slamming my truck Doig294 into higher gear on a flat stretch of the road when I saw a shallow trench of potholes ahead With no traffic coming I swerved at a slight angle across the holes to reduce the jolt There was a bounce and a second and the horizon plunged away as a concussion crumpled the rear of the truck down into a howling tilting skid dust fuming into the cab metal screaming on gravel At last I sat stopped looking straight up into the air gripping the steering wheel which now haloed above my face I groped the door open and bailed for the road The truck angled above me like a monstrous being with a broken lower back I looked blankly toward where the rear wheels had to be and there were none It took me long minutes amid the spilled wheat and strewn gravel to track out what had happened The rear spring on one side of the truck weakened from an old break had snapped entirely when the wheels and the following force of the other A away the trucks underbody springs axle wheels and all When the rancher arrived and had a look he said I was not to blame myself and it was time he bought a new truck anyway I was behind a steering wheel for him again the next morning When the chance came to spend a Sunday with Dad and Grandma I showed them the newspaper clipping about my accident You were lucky that once Grandma said in Doig 295 judgment as if I hadnt been thinking it every instant since Im no example to talk Dad offered but no job is worth your neck The next summer when I was working fields for a farmer near Dupuyer I came in from the tractor one sunset to hear that a truck had been wrecked on the breakneck hill killing its driver Ron Now that I had gone across one line of decision in the summer of the stormhit sheep it began to dawn on me that I was edging across the next one Ranching no longer seemed what I wantefthat clarifying idea and likely Mrs Tidymans galeforce enthusiasm pointed toward college For Grandma my first mention of it was the knell that one more person she had labored for would be on his way from her But If thats the how of it for you boy you better do it Dad came around to the idea so rapidly and entirely that he began to think of it as his own By God yes you want to get into some other sort of living Ranching is a hard go unless you inherit a hellish amount of land and have the health to work it I never had those and maybe you wont either One of his brothers had managed to send a son to college to become a pharmacist Dad suggested that I think about the same I didnt know what livelihood I wanted but pharmacy didnt sound like it Dad shrugged Do whatever it is you want son and well back you just as far as we can Doig 296 Any backing to be drawn from a life divided between the Jensen ranch and the Reservation I knew was chancy It became chancier a few days after I finished my nexttolast year of high school The morning of our third spring gather of the sheep for the Reservation drive we had edged the band onto the highway when Grandma missed Kittens annual yowls from the trailer house The goodfornothing wheres he got to Somehow Kitten had squirmed his way out and Dad sent me back to the ranch in the Jeep to look for him I found the cat in the yard there and also a family who were moving into the house still warm from our leaving Got it leased for a couple of years they retorted when I demanded to know how long they would be there Even McGrath seasoned conniver that he was seemed shaken by the wordless withdrawal of the Jensen ranch from us And Dad and Grandma now faced a Reservation summer with no point of return at its end The one thing plain in this new muddle was that the arrangement with McGrath was fractured The three of us were agreed that we wanted no more of his risky ranches and jinxed sheeiralso if the summer could be passed without catastrophe roaring in from the mountains or grabbing up out of the earth this would at last be a year when we had made good money from the sheep and could afford some new start How about if we stay on until Mac can sell Doig297 the ewes this fall Dad suggested Might take a month or soafter the lambs are shipped but we can tell him thats all were walking away from his damned sheep if hes not rid of them by then Good enough I said Hunkydory by me Grandma said I wont shed tears over old McGrath It was this final herding season for Dad and Grandma that I spent on the trucking job near the Canadian border and my exploded truck was not the only blast mark on our summer I arrived to visit at the trailer house one Sunday to be told that Kitten had vanished several days before Dad figured that an eagle had ended his stalking career Anotber Sunday as I stepped from the car only Spot pawed ecstatically up at me Wheres Tip I asked quickly and Grandmas face told that there no longer was a Tip Dad again gave me the details the black dog at last had become the casualty of his chasingandbiting habit sneaking from camp to run with a dog pack on the range west along the Two Medicine Dad had heard in Browning that the sheepmen came onto the dogs and shot several of them in their tracks Tip had to have been among them He got what he was asking for Grandma began and broke off in silent tears as Spot eyed around at us to choose one for his next fond nuzzle Only the sheep seemed immune from calamity that summer The lambs fattened and fattened and brought a top price Doig298 at shipping time McGrath next located stubblefields south of Dupuyer where the ewes could graze for a few weeks That autumns trailing of the sheep southward was our longest ever nearly sixty miles Dad and Grandma wearily waited in the trailer house amid the blond stubble for the sale of the sheep A buyer was found the ewes we had struggled over for a dozen seasons in the Jensen rhythm of vanished in a gray blatting stream into boxcars On a day in early November of 1956 we drove north to Cut Bank to settle our finances with McGrath Dadgy as ever he was to meet us in a hotel room there I spent the trip dreaming of showdowns Give us our money or Ill break your ugly damn face I could all but hear the same battle breaking out in Grandmas mind God darn you ornery old cuss we did all the work for three years and you think youre gonna keep the money in your dirty paws you got another think coming As we parked in front of the hotel Dad said I want you two to wait here I know how Im going to handle this Half an hour later he climbed in the car and showed us a check for our full share McGrath had taken our calculations without a question made out our amount and said only You people did a powerful amount of work for me The one thing the three of us agreed on next was that we should not move away in this my last year of high 0 Doig299 if there was any mooring in our lives now it was my schooling We moved into a small house in Dupuyer beyond the Chadwicks a place with all its space in one expansive room as if the walls of the trailer house had been pulled several times wider and longer Again my paperback books teetered in stacks as they had in Ringling again Grandma pulled out a for herself each night Spot strewed J himself beneath our feet as amply as Shep ever had Weary of the steady life with the Lady do ye realize its been nineteen months since either of us had a day off Dad ground out one eveningJDad and Grandma decided to wait until spring to look for their next work When the ranches busied up then a lambing man of his skills and a cook of hers would have no trouble finding jobs The leisure had its uses moment from when A their canyons of stone into the sky edge we at last had time to set foot in the On a crisp and bright day Dad shot a fat young buck beneath one of the great rimfolds driven up into the blue Tommy Chad and I skidded the carcass down through the scree and timber and we had meat for weeks to come Grandma visited with Gertie at the cafe and as we should have known it would work came looking for her Dupuyer lacked babysitters Doig300 especially babysitters with five raisings of children to their credit Grandma began spending entire days with the small daughters of a family busy with travel then evenings for other families When a night came that two stints of work were offered her at once she eyed Dad Why dont you take this other one Charlie I looked at him the fight to start Instead he said Yes and why the hell dont I Through the evenings of winter after that the two of them regularly went babysitting several times a week The notion at first embarrassed me it didnt seem genuine work for grownups especially for my tophand father But I began to see that they both enjoyed the change of task and scene The household was easier to breathe in when we werent crammed against each other every moment The pair of them soon had more babysitting than they could handle and I took some evenings of it myself It was I way for Dupuyer to lend us a hand and for us I to lend one in turn not the least of the towns graceful moments in our life In that last year of high school 180 classroom days between me and the world I began threshing for ways to go away to college I did not know it and it seemed least likely but the one ally more I needed I met on the football fieldffr had begun playing the autumn before Doig 301 when my knee finally was declared healed My season was brief that time as if the quadrants of my body were going to take turns about this my left hand was fractured in one of the first scrimmages I suppose in the way Dad never had hesitated to swing back into a saddle after another of his on horseback it didnt occur to me not to try football againtalthough it did to Grandma who loudly sounded her Gee gosh you be careful it turned out on the field at the first practice a new coach was waiting a chunky man in his early twenties His name was McCarthy he had grown up in the smelter town of Anaconda and gone through a small Jesuit college on a football scholarship He told me without ever having seen me before that I would be his fullback Given Valiers small enrollment and the lack of heft among the seniors he had decided simply to field the four quickest of us as running backs like dice flipped across green felt Youll be the blocking back since youre heftier than Butch or Vern or 155 pounds I actually was only the least featherlikekand well show these teams some footsteps We did Ours was the fastest backfield in the conference and the most fitful On the first play of the season we scored on an run and went on to lose the game When we managed to mesh less than Doig 302 half the wins scatted onto our record Other games we simply whooshed up and down the field between the goal lines instead of across them perpetually within a touchdown of stronger and more methodical teams and exasperating everyone except McCarthy who seemed to enjoy our velocity for its own sake4The season of football was one of the least useful and most purely pleasant things I had ever done a time taken out from life simply to run and roll like a colt discovering his gallop Perhaps it was for my willingness to be an atomweight fullback for him perhaps he simply liked to see a person spin free and be off to somewhere McCarthy out of the blue asked my college plans listened to my vague notion that I guessed I would aim for science or engineering and told me that I should think about journalism may have been the first time I heard the word journalism spoken But youve read more than any kid Ive ever seen and if youve been paying attention in there to the Last I think ou have youve learned something about the language Here was advice which could have come from nowhere else in my all her interest in me Mrs Tidyman could not have brought herself to single out one direction from her whirling compass of learning and no one else I knew had ever offered more than the vague encouragement that with a head like that on your shoulders you ought to go on to college Doig303 Throughout the autumn and start of colleges and took exams A any I sent off applications to scholarship competition I could find Mrs Tidyman thirty years before had gone away to Illinois for summer courses Northwestern University I automatically applied there I read somewhere that rich universities such as Harvard and Princeton admitted a proportion of moneyless students off went my paperwork And to a dozen others according to no plan but hope No one seemed to know another method besides my own of flooding mail out across the map no one in either line of my family had ever gone beyond high school and even Mrs Tidyman could not recall the last Valier student who had attended an college Amid it all Eldo stopped me in the assembly hall and said he wanted to see me in his office When I stepped in he picked up the latest of my scholarship applications and shook his wide head Ivan all this isnt worth it These eastern places youre applying to a student from a school this size just doesnt have a chance Make up your mind to go to the university at Missoula and you wont let yourself in for disappointment He held the application toward me I dont feel I can put in any more of my time on these things From then I knew that I would go to one of the far universities if I had to walk there on my knees and murder Doig 304 to get in Eldo was not a man for a goading strategy In telling me that he was tired of the scholarship paperwork he was simply reciting fact and saying as well that he was weary of me and my beavering ambition But writing me off was the one valuable thing he could have done for me I went to my backers with his verdict Thats very interestfng Mrs Tidyman said with deadly evenness I think you should apply and apply and Ill write any recommendations you need GoddamnthatEldotohell Dad burred you go on and get one of those scholarships just to show that scissorbill A winter of waiting the babysitting winter Then with the first of spring a letter Northwestern saying that I had been granted a fouryear scholarship for full tuition I had won that much Now the question became how the rest of my victory could be afforded Dad and Grandma quickly went back to ranch work now for a Two Medicine rancher named McTaggart He was a high crag of a man wintry boulderjawed longboned who had been battling the northern plains for half a century and at last had edged far enough ahead of nature to own a ranch and a few thousand head of sheep No one was deceived that McTaggart and Dad and Grandma made a ranch combination that could last be lucky if we can put up with his guff through lambing time Dad the three of Doig305 them somehow went week after week without ignitingf When I visited from the Chadwicks on weekends McTaggart in the evenings would fix himself by the hour on a topic such as my going off to Northwestern and recite his history around it in a nervous twining style He too had gone to Chicago as a young man he told spending some months there when he worked for a buyer who dealt in ranch horses We took em into Chicago to the yards for him see There was one bunch they wanted for lead horses for the race track see Them hotblooded horses you know they got to lead em inththat fella with the white uants and the red jacket and big hat you know he leads them in on some gentle cow pony might be a Apaloosy or somethin I had these nine ten ponies headed out for Washinaton Park race track then old Bill caught up to me says Oh I made a mistake So I ust tailed them load of horses to one another and away I went a street Halste that with them ponies about 35 miles Had kids followin me all the way An I made it no trouble they was gentle enough ponies One of em I used to ride out here and he used to buck me off whenever he wanted but back there hed got on good behavior First thing at the race track hes so pretty they give him a bath and put one of those Doig 306 muley saddles on and I had to get on and ride him around the race track show him off good and plenty Oh I been to Chicago nnnhnnnn Dad said he could talk McTaggart into hiring me for the summer before I went to college Grandma pointed out it would be our last time together before you go off so awful far away But I still wanted my summer distance and gave the one argument I thought was sure that I could make more money at tractor work on a farm then on the ranch with them You never done any of that work before Grandma rallied I said the unanswerable Ill learn A few mornings after my graduation from high school I hunkered atop the cleated treads of a Caterpillar traptor big as a locomotive and studied what seemed to be the control gadgetry for the entire solar system With the farmer all but moving my hands through the patterns I memorized the switchwork and to start the Cats rackety warming tbc eodn J inside the sheetmetal cab then another battery of hydraulic levers to raise and lower the equipment being pulled behind the tractor He rode with me a few rounds on the field showing me the quick dance of brake andclutch to the monster around corners and said Shes all yours I could see that the field corners were going to be the gauntlet the Cat had to be sharply angled in its turn kinked back on its own path until it swiveled Doig307 the wide harrow around behind it instant calculation upon calculation to keep the roaring train of equipment from hour I kinked the tractor through a turn an instant too long The cataract of steel tread caught the hitch of the harrow bowed and twisted it to taffy shut down the Cat and stood looking at the tangle I could read the Latin of whatever Caesars farmers had done but would I ever decipher this gigantic equipment of my own Sick with failure I drove into Dupuyer with the crumpled hitch The farmer scowled at it then saw my face Well dont get in an uproar over it The kid I had last summer did this three times on his first day Try not to beat his record Ill forge er back into shape He did and in the hundreds of hours of field work afterward this summer I ran the tractor and its caravan of equipment as faultlessly as if on rails That set of summer months an even twenty years ago as I come to write this stands out as a season in dream Shuddered throb of the Cat curved tines of harrow digging by the battalion behind me marching chocolate lines worked field cold flamepeaks spacing the western everything of each day was rhythm pulse pattern and within such propulsion like a space traveler sledding through orbit I could cast myself free into every luster Doig308 of my life to come Four college years of reading how many books can that be dozens and scores and hundreds perfect grades Dad saying youre right up there with the best of them in the world now eyes of a girl inches away Carlton says it is like losing your breath over and over words of my own in print how to begin Montana today is a land of far fields uncommon people a flow of money Grandma I never knew they oay wages like that and then then Then tugging of gravity a letter in a long envelope The last editorial I had written for the school paper had been noticed at the university in Missoula The dean of journalism was asking if I would be interested in a scholarship there and if he could come talk to I phoned Mrs Tidyman from the cafe in Dupuyer she told me the dean had been a Rhodes Scholar an honor so vast I had heard of it Early into the next week he drove to Dupuyer and was directed to where I was farming that day Tall trim in white shirt and tie he toed across the furrowed field to where I was pulling the armada of harrow behind the Caterpillar As I stepped down from the Cat and dustily shook hands he said What is this a discer and I learned at once that Rhodes Scholars didnt know everything in the world But he talked earnestly seemed unbothered as he stood with the soft field dirt trickling into his lowcut shoes and asked if I wanted really to be away from Montana Doig309 For all the dreaming that was the question in me and his asking of it and the promise of a scholarship at Missoula made me rethink One way and another Dad and Grandma and I had survived much together She now was sixty four years old and although she gave every evidence of enduring forever I had begun to think of her age and the sum that would go from my life when she did Dad was fiftySeven of breakages still ajop hand but with his lifetimes worth in beyond the two of them there were the decades of effort of the other Doigs and Ringers a weight of striving in these Montana hills and valleys and prairies which added up to the single great monument my family line would ever have For me to go from this would be a reverse trek in a sense from the immigration which had borne my people into the highmountain West Yet they had sprung themselves free of the past when they felt they had to and that was my own urge4r took the decision to McTaggarts ranch the next weekend Grandma brightened Thatd be closer to home if you went over to Missoula Chicago is such a long old ways away Dad shook his head You got to do the deciding Skavinsky WellbackyoutOthelimitwhateverplaceyougo The train to Chicago stood like an endless wall of windows Each of the three of us snuffled in the September air turned aside to swallow Grandmas teary hug as Doig310 ever she had talked herself around to the conviction that whatever I had made up my mind to do was the only thing you write us about it all and Ill do the like Dads clamping handshake in awe of all the education awaiting a big place I had a minute me Youre away to of looking out the window to them the one stout and erect and eternal as a pillar the other handsome as glory under the perfect crimp of his stockmans hat The train gave off sounds and the depot platform rafted away behind me with the two of them Doig 311 Son Sire The grand calved on in grandson grandmother The words of all the ties of blood interest me for they seem never quite deft enough not entirely bold and guileful enough to speak the mysterious strengths of lineage I admit the marvel that such sounds are carried to us from the clangs and soughs of tongues now silent a millenium into the past calling on and on in their way light still traveling in from gone stars But the offhand resonance of bobolink arrives that way too and sneeze and whicker and daisy and thousandfold words more What I miss in our special bloodwords is a sense of recasting themselves for each generation each fresh situation of kindredness1it seems somehow too meager that they should g merely exist plain packets of sound like any other and not hold power to texture each new conformation with the bright exact tones that are yearned for This example here is a man and here a woman In the coming light of one June morning the same piece of life is axed away from each of them Wounded hard they go off to their private ways Until at last the wifeless man offers across to the woman And I am the agreed barter between them Not even truth broughtdown to bone this way can begin to tell what I long to of the situation shared by my rer Doig312 and my grandmother and myself during the years I call from memory here For my father had to be more than is coded in the standard sixletter sound of father he had also to be and as well husband to the daunting third figure of the household In turn that figure my loving grandmother who never had thought through roles of life but could don the most hazardous ones as automatically as her apron had somehow to mother me without the usual claims to authority for it and at the same time to treat with her soninlaw in terms which could not be like a wifes but seemed not much closer to any other description either I believe that I inherited the clearest most fortunate part in this allowed simply to be and to have the grant of a bolstered parent and the bonus of a redoubtable grandparent at my side as well Yet even that lacks faithful wording how can it be expressed that a boys dreams of himself and his of a yearnings so often drawn opposite each other in him somehow were the same tuggings And less explicable yet the materialized fact that at last whenever it had happened that they found the habit of being together counted more strongly with them than the
