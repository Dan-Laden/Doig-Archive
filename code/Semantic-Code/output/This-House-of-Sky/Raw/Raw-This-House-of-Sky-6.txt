of sheened serving counters long stoves giant square refrigeratorsfGerties cafe could have been set down inside it in a dozen different places A pair of mahogany4faced cooks rattled to each other in a language I could not even guess at Two black women were dabbing lettuce leaves into hundreds of salad bowls I walked on through to the white tiled dishroom at the far end and stepped into warm cottony air A bald man with skin the color of coffee with rich cream in it was blasting a jet of steaming water onto mounds of dirty plates He turned stuck out a dripping hand to be shaken Yo you the new man My name is Archie I said mine was Ivan Yo Ivory This heres what we do in here j Small tight penciling at the top of the quiz paper Please see me after class Above the words like a cold halfmoon hung over a battlef iel their reason the grade of Q the first of my life The history class went its hour with fear after f ear s awing at the back of my mouth Godamighty am I going to flunk out of here must have been a mistake must what will I tell what could I have how am I goinq to After eternity the bell rang the Doig316 instructor walked me to his office In a dozen steadying ways he said a single thing that memorized dates and facts would not carry me in college as they had in high school I must think out essay answers now When I at last stood to leave his wide hornrimmed glasses caught me like headlights Dont let it throw you Mr Doig Youll do better here than youve started out Those first earthquake weeks of Northwestern his was the one classroom voice to say such words to me His course was the one I felt my way through to my first college grade of A Dearest Ivan We are glad your getting squared away and that you like your board job fine Thats a lot of dishes to every day and every day isnt it Is the grub good there I sure hope so Were glad your getting to know your journalism adviser Professer Baldwin he sounds like a lot of help to you Dad thought it was a good joke that he thought you would show up at colege wearing a cowboy hat Dad says to tell you we can get you a pair of bat wing shaps and a rope if it will help your studies Your loveing Trains began to calendar my life In midSeptember the hours eastward from Montana to Chicago Three months and return west now the prairies hour I Doig317 upon hour out the panning frame of window The eastbound again usually on the day after New Years in glittering openskied weather The abrupt roundtrip in March two and a half days traveling to spend five or six days in Montana And early June the greenest journey most unsettling with its growing cargo of time before or after in my life throbbed quite as those firstofsummer journeys did Trains cross the continent in a swirl of dust and thunder I would read at times from Thomas Wolfe as if turning the manuscript pages of as the words boomed from the orator himselfpthe leaves fly down the tracks behind them the great trains cleave through gulch and gulley they rumble with spoked thunder on the bridges over the powerful brown wash of mighty rivers they toil through hills they skirt the rough brown stubble of shorn fields they whip past em t stations in the little towns and their great stride pounds its even pulse across was the vital rhythm of this travel was me Even as my American prairie I separately free of the given lines the machinery had to cling to Already I had my habit of totaling up life and in the train hours I could count the steps taken in the college year and those still to come course upon course in writing and reporting the adventuring into the Russian language as I had once followed Doig318 Mrs Tidyman into Latin the immensities of history and literature I knew nothing of an eventual destination except that it would be somewhere that I could work at writing for now the addingup to get there held its own wonder The train hours were the enforced pause in time when all this marshalled in my mind When I stepped down again to a Montana depot platform Dad or Grandma would ask as ever How was your trip I would begin one telling or There was a herd of antelope fortyfifty of them on the flats a bit ago or We were held up a helluva time in Miles City waiting for a freight any answer but the private truth which said what a headlong striding time those journeys were J When I returned to Montana in early June of 1958 for the summer between my first and second years at Northwestern I came for a change into a season which was creamy with luck Dad and Grandma still were at the McTaggart ranch and as content for the moment as the pair of them were likely to be I at once found a farming job this time on the irrigated flatland near Valier The farmer proved the easiest going of men interested in my college career and admiring me for it the fields I worked sprung grain high and golden against the ripsawhorizon of the Rockies and a hailstorm as we watched from the front window of the farmhouse like spectators at a race went shaving past without touching a Doig319 kernel of the evening a week or so before my nineteenth birthday when I hurried to Valier to cash my first paycheck of the summer and then drove on slower now trying to think through the steps of the matter north into the oilfield town of Shelby Years of rumor had roughsketched the location of the house for me but I found I couldnt pick it from among several along a hilly street Swallowing back the flutters which winged up from deepest in me I veered downtown singled out the busiest saloon Inside I sipped at a bottle of beer nervously and intently watched the crowd along the bar When a burly drinker clopped away toward the toilet I swung off my bar stool after him He already was spraddled at the urinal trough humming purposefully when I joined him He looked over at me cheerily Beerll do it to you dont it I gulped what I hoped was grinning agreementLsure slides throughand faked around at the front of myself until he zipped and turned away My zipping a fast echo of his I spun after him Ah say I was wonderin if you could tell me ah where the place up on the hill is I dont know this town yet Oh hell yeah buddy he began You take this street down to the corner n goleft I imprinted the directions on my brain like commandments as he mapped them in the air for me n when you get there therell be a black gal kind of a maid shell let you in n ask who you want He paused Doig320 like a clerk switching lists of inventory I aint sayin this is your first visit but if it happens to be ask for Estelle Shes got legs sweet as a preachers dream squeeze the last ounce right out o you Estelle and her talent branded in atop the street directions I breathed out as if tons had been swung off me and tried to fumble a silver dollar into his hand Here let me buy you a couple beers Naw hell He pushed the midair money back to me as if he were a croupier paying off Spend it up on the hill J tr Comin through Ivory dishes comin through I snap myself away from watching the coed in the silken blouse choose her salad Let er come Arch Grunting he pushes rack after rack of dishes into the metal tunnel of machine between us Soap is fogged on cogs lurch the cargo into drenches of hot water the last scald billows its dragonssnort of steam around me The first rack jostles from the machine breathes heat from its eighteen dinner plates glistening upright in twin rows Do em pretty calls Mister Hurd behind me over the machines watery roar I fork my fingers pull five plates at once with my right hand four in my left flip them together into a stack with a clattering rifflys if having shuffled a giant deck of cards made of china pivot and slap the fat pile of dishware onto the cart behind me My second grab Doig321 empties the rack I send it scooting alonl ooor 1J1 u til it noses to a stop inches from he can A put a hand down for it without steamwrapped racks the swift double grab and flip again and again the plate piles multiply as if uncoiling upward out of themselves Across the dishroom at the sink where he washes the glassware Mister Hurd is Archie or me chanting a story as much to himself as to l A ere t f

as well and Chicago comes as a giant wonder to him Tell you Is in a big store this mornin and I see the talles man in my life Is behind him and tell ou Is lookn at him ri ht jabbing a thumb to his

there you thinkc I decide too before I can know I have done so Tell you Arch he must just be seein the sights all the time and all the tirne hmm Mister minutes so pleased at his first joshing in life Hurd giggles for new Doig322 Rank on rank along Sheridan Road past the Northwestern campus deepporched houses hung forth their sets of Greek initials much as the vital gold pin of affiliation tendered itself out to the world on the angora jut of a pledge sisters sweater The universitys preponderant Greek systemMLI never heard the words without the echo of the expression Dad and the valley men had for being deeply baffled Its Greek to seemed to be meant to bin students into housefuls as alike themselves as could be achieved It worked wonderfully there were entire fraternities and sororities where everyone looked like a first cousin of everyone else And the systems snugness paced itself on from there Rush Week to Homecoming to winter proms to May Week and with keg parties and mixers betweentimes residents of Greek Row could count on a college life as preciously tempoed as a cotillion By comparison those of us in Latham House were like bandannaed gypsies grinning rudely beyond been quite sure what to do with the property or for that matter with those of us who lived there as financialaid students The building was a glum and aged duplex which hunched by itself at the edge of Evanstons downtown area as if too to grope across the street to the actual campus Where Lathams exterior didnt show several Doig 323 decades of urban soot it had been blobbed with grayish paint 1k Inside the same simply had tided across the doorsill and lapped o up every wall in sight ftHere the buildings odd outer look of frailty and exhaustion quickly explained itself a colossal incision an air shaft some six feet across all but sawed the place in half from back to front Behind the thin streetside bay of facade there were stitches of connection only at the front stairwell landing and at a passageway or two which bridged the halves of the house at its top floor Except for these quick nips seaming it together Latham House stood a decrepit frigate sprung an ancient cliffdwelling cut apart by earthquake If Latham tottered as a single uncertain roof over two separate hives of rooms it also sheltered some forty wildly distinct nooks of mind Here is Votapek on his way to a concert career coming in from each days practice of Chopin to walk ritually to the ancient upright piano at the back of the house and tinkle the first bars of Nola DOO de doo DE doo de doo Here Benjamin holding constant stage in the front hall now spieling Shakespeare now doing his impersonation of Wrigley Field arms arced wide to be the outfie11es to capacity out of his mouth A eyes bulging a crowd heard blocks away The same again this time in silence his version Doig 324 of an open date on the baseball schedule Then Zimrnerman standing atop one or another of the steam radiators like a penguin on a snowbank hands forgotten in oockets as he mulls through the visualized pages of his philosophy texts All of this and vastly more came with the mesh of tensions brought by us inside the walls of Latham On many of us family hopes rode heavily perhaps as the first ever to have made it to college or as the one to step to success in the place of a dead brother or lost father or simply to bear the lineage out of one or another crimped corner of American life SeveralAthe Votapeks the Benjamins amonq us1already had the fervors of artistic performance cooking Almost everyone was under the gun of the high gradepoint average needed to keep scholarship funds arriving Such pressures gave Latham House a charged ozonelike atmosphere at once intense and giddy Strange fevers came and went among us I think of the year of intrcmural sports dedicated to losing was standing policy at Latham to scorn all campus activities Homecoming alone rated a special gesture usually out the front windows of had come from small high schools where we had been encouraged into sports intrqfmurals were e ception to the boycott But eeR we ielded Latham teams of such ferocious hopelessness1Lin tag football a

became phantom competitors in all available leagues avidly posted the standings which showed us automatically winless By the last of spring quarter our softball zeroes chaining off the end of earlier forfeits the Latham mural program had perfected itself out of existence Latham House if any single sum can be put to it was a scuffed restive Aleutianatoll of a place to spend ones college yearsand every whit of it suited me Friends from then tell me now and the evidence of habit still is with me that in the Latham gallery of behavior I was something of a t JtAflto I was asked a dozen times in my first two days whether I I had just come out of military service so much beyond an eighteenyearold freshman did I look and behave In the year I roomed with Zimmerman stubby and even more baldish than I was beginning to be the pair Doig326 of us stood out like a pair of solemn veteran sergeants among green recruits However gleefully I could join in epidemics such as the obliteration of intramurals I was careful about J what went on in my head on a regular basis was a job I recognized I could do well and I did it typing up my course notes and working on systems of underlining and outlining until I had private hand7crafted texts all my own bearing down hardest it counted journalism curriculum and history courses chanting Russian verb declensions to myself as Archie plunged the rackloads of dishes through the machine to me and running a second randomasever education for myself in offhand books alongside the coursework Northwestern was tagged at the time with the reputation of being a countryclub universityan epithet as exotic to me as profanity from Mars Greek Row was ridiculous but not it also had redoubts of famous professionalism in its schools of music speech and journalism In the school of journalism I tapped luck one more time drawing as my advisor a new faculty member named Ben Baldwin A cherubfaced man with a passion for work he had among the batch of students assigned to him a handful of us from the West and recognized at once our smalltown capacity for chores and perseverance Again as under Frances Tidymans gaudy wing I was given encouragement and answered with effort I One thing further I gained from Latham House and ws Doig 327 a room of my own the first of my life Throughout Lathams welter of oddangled walls and random hallways were a few leftover pouches of space which had been made into single d l f fJJJflooJ rooms an in my Junior year I qua lied for The Shoe a room nicknamed for its shoebox dimensions There was barely space to edge into The Shoe between the cot crowded against one wall and the dresser against the other The metal clothes closet for the room stood outside the door in the hallwayr l r11act OT c fat thwarted by a narrow gatehe ca11e f18Fdil f171L Soe rlJer I I saw t e chance to swap its spindly desk for a huge handsomelyshelved one down the hall With the biggest furniture dismantled as much the rest into the room and across the far I could wedged a and reassembled asc1 there like an oak galleon in a bottle Alone and A thoroughly outfitted I levered my grades up more sdfoJ my readingjacross the shelves of my vast desk Dinese A beside Faulkner hats with Wilder Dearest Ivan Just some lines to tell you we are counting the days till you come home for summer I am at the Higgins ranch outside Ringling with Dad now Cooking for the Dad says he can 9et you on the crew here for summer That QA b way we can be all together for a while again there is a place upstairs in the cookhouse here for you to sleep The job will Doig 328 be haying mostly they put up a whole lot of hay Your loveing grandma I J Behind the bale stack the pair of us sat waiting for the morning to inch on Jeff swore steadily like a sewer gurgling after a downpour sparrowheaded sonofabitch him anyhow 11 show the bastard he can keep his goddamn stack fences Jeff was burly brightnosed and do the sonsabitches hisself with decades of boozing tobaccostained at the corners of his mouth from the splatters he exploded to punctuate the cusswords His forehead sloped back under his greasy hat andlhis mind Scct rcQ j sloped off into hatreds and furies I In the bunkhouse after breakfast he had crossed tempers with the rancher as the days work was doled out It had been only an instant Jeff going hardmouthed as quickly as he had flared Now the two of us sent out together to fence haystacks he had been in eruption all morning in one spate sledgehammering posts into the ground as if he were a fencebuilding machine in the next plopping behind the haystack to curse some more I know hes the worlds bastard to work with Dad had said but hes an old hand on this place and if you say anything against him therell be hard feelings for all three of us Stand the scissorbill if you can will ye I thought back to my farming summers at Dupuyer and Valier alone on a tractor with the north mountains to sight on over the silent rich Doig329 pattern of fields and began to count the suckegg sonofabitch August never seen such a jangledup spread half of September brain like a bedbug until I would step aboard the train toward Northwestern again Back from whatever chore had taken me into Ringling I turned the ignition key to kill the motor of the pickup and stared with dread at the cookhouse Then I stepped down and went in to say what to be told Dad quizzed me with a quick look Its Angus I said I heard it in town His horse fell with him while he and the boys were working calves Theyve got him at the hospital in White Sulphur My father whitened and whispered JustlikeJim But there was to be a grim difference this second brother of his to die off the back of a horse lay unconscious for more before the last life went from him Each trip to and from Northwestern hinged into a midzmorning wait between trains in St Paul I made it a habit to leave Union Depot and walk the neighborhood nosing into a store dawdling over coffee in one halfawake cafe or another and going at last back toward the depot along a hill street overlooking the Mississippi River which I liked for its great fjordlike channel gouging through the coldest of these mornings as I stood at the river overlook Doig330 a last minute a noise scuffed close behind me I turned quickly to find two tanskinned men tottering in broken shoes and wavery caps and dirtstiffened blue jeans Buddy the bigger and less drunk one began to recite you ever heard of Ira Hayes Ira Hayes was Navajo like us Come off the Gila River Resvation Wait buddy Listen You know about Iwo Jima in that war Sonuvabitch island there in that war When they put that flag up there on that Iwo Jima Ira Hayes was one of em Know that buddy An he come home big hero An one morning they find him dead on the ground Like that Drowned in his own puke Passed out choked to death in his own puke buddy Muscatel got him Helluva way for dying buddy The second Navajo wobbled tried to firm himself somewhere between dignified listening and the threatening hunch of his mate I used the interruption put a silver dollar in the air before me as I time This time it was shakily grabbed The pitchers mound at Wrigley Field swelled from the infield grass like the back of a giant turtle swimming in a dark green seaand atop it I was throwing as teeterily as if the turtle had caught the hiccups My stride awkward on the curved height a pitch to Grant in the batters box would fly high and away from him then the next one explode off the dirt r Doig331 Schulte behind his camera tripod began to look dismayed The May morning was his1this idea to meet a course assignment in filmmaking with a quick reel of baseball instruction his notion that because Grant and I knew something about baseball we would be his cast his family connection with the management of the Chicago Cubs ushered the trio of us into the empty his film whirring away in frames of me firing baseballs to sky and earth I drew a breath looked up at the colossal shell grandstand roof above us its high straight lines fitted onto the sky above the greenandbuf f geometry of the baseball field I grinned into the giddy expanse of it all and got down to business lobbing the ball catch with a toddler Grant timed now as tamely as if playing the spongy and smashed ground hits which went whopping in huge easy bounces into the outfield Encouraged Schulte filmed busily What else do we show he asked at last Ive got to fill five minutes of reel I trotted to first base poised myself a short three steps off the bag broke for second with my left leg coming across to put me in full stride splayed into a ragged hook slide Twice more as Schulte shot Then Grant fielded balls I rolled to him at shortstop a bear scooping into the caretended dirt and pawing the ball across to an invisible first baseman Each baseball gave off an instant after expectation a hard whunk as it ended its catchless Doig332 throw against the grandstand as if the geometric gravity which drew such heaves into a first basemans glove had broken down Grant kept on his barrage of pellets thwacking against a cliff of I went to the outfield and caught balls Grant lobbed high for me the do like white satellite diving to me with surprising dazzle down the backdrop of thousands of vanished spectators My throws on a single bounce across home plate skidded through to make the eerie delayed whunk more metallic now against the foul screen At last Schulte doubtfully said he supposed he had filmed enough Now my wage in the bargain we had set I carried a bucket of balls to home plate Swinging a bat as hard as I could I found I could mortar a ball to where the center fielder might stand and catch it with a casual saluting flip of his walked from the plate around the high bubble of pitchers mound to second base Standing over the square wad of canvas I tossed swung hard and now the balls flew up to arc out over the ivydressed outfield walls dropping into the bleachers in wild clunking ricochets through the empty seats I hit bucket after bucket until my hands began to wear raw Dearest folks Professor Baldwin has offered me a summer here at college I would be teaching and counseling in an institute they run here for high school students interested in journalism It would be for five weeks and I can Doig 333 earn more than I can at Higgins all summer But it would mean I wont be able to come home until middle of August Dear son If you want the summer job back there you ought to take it Your Grandma and I will miss you and wish we could all be together again this summer but it dont always work out that way We will be happy to see you when you come home later on With love Dad Early in my senior year when I had begun to write fillers for a magazine in Milwaukee and when an article of mine was the only one by an undergraduate in the glossy new quarterly being published by the school of journalism Holden my closest friend in Latham squinted toward me through his steady fog of cigarette smoke and said Damn you Doig youre just gonna be bigger than any of us arent you I thought that over as I did everything and faced my judgment on myself No Thomas not necessarily so As if arguing against myself in the spring of 1961 I finished up my intended four years at Northwestern by being awarded a scholarship for a year of graduate study I bargained a military deferment out of my draft board and set to work again at the school of journalism A pair of messages markered my completion of that year When the last pages of my thesis Doig334 were handed back from their final reading by one of my research advisors a note was clipped atop Around 1836 and 1837 people used to stand on the dock in New York and wait for the latest installment of the Pickwick Papers With something of the same anticipation Ive waited for and read the chapters of your thesis The other arrived from Grandma Dearest Ivan Well dear one I have sad news for you Mrs Tidaman that you liked so much at Valier died a couple days ago Ill send you the clipping out of the Gt Falls paper when I get my hands on it Gertie says in her letter that Mrs Tidaman fell at school and broke her hip and died somehow of that Im sorry dear I know she was a wonderfull person to you At dawn the pewter sky beginning to warm to blue above the Castles across the valley Dad and I already were stepping from the Jeep at timberline on Grass Mountain Grandma had climbed out of bed when we did given us coffee and sweet rolls made sandwiches out of her bread saw us J out the door with Dont bring home more grouse than all of Ringling can eat Beside her on the porch Spot stood planted in astonishment and alarm that he wasnt being invited into the Jeep with us Dad hesitated No fella Not today September frost underfoot a testing frost the lightest dust of white on the broad bunchgrass crest of mountain Dad handed me the singleshot 22 then the small box of bullets Doig335 to put in my jacket pocket I shook out a cartridge barely longer than my thumbnail clicked it into the breech Carrying the light rifle underhand on the side of my body away from Dad I started along the mountain slorebeside him He had a hunters voice which could soften just enough not to carry far and yet be heard clearly My own nosedived in and out of mutter as I answered him He showed me herding sites remembered from three decades before game trails angling up and across the summit like agelines on a vast forehead homestead splotches on the saged skirts of the valley far below us In trade I told him everything I knew of my ahead basic training at the Air Force base in San Antonio a training school probably elsewhere in Texas for the rest of those months The first grouse caught us both in mi i tep as it flailed like a hurled wad of gray leaves into the air in front of us That mustve been one of yours I said And whos carrying the gun along like a crowbar froze to his hand As ready and free a laugh as I could ever remember from my father Ye could at least have throwed it at him In minutes I shot the next grouse before it could fly I handed Dad the rifle Here see if you learned anything from that I put the bird in the sack he held out to me followed it seconds later with the one he shot from the top of a log fifty yards away I like to give mine a bit of a Doig 336 chance ye see instead of sneakin up till Im standin on their tailfeathers The rifle traded back and forth we each missed shots made more At mid9morning and four birds apiece we knew the hunting was over but kept walking the mountainside Right about over there up over that little park ye see Dad pointed A time there was a whole bunch ten or twelve of us ridin back to the Basin from a dance at Deep Creek one night Even Mrs Christison she was up in years she was along with us We got caught in a blizzard up here and all got lost off the road the whole bunch of us goin in a circle for about two hours Finally we decided the best thing to do was just to sit down wait and see if itd clear up We got off our horsesfiit wasnt cold snowin like sixty but it was warmLand sat down on a bank there After awhile it let up and the moon come out so we could look around and the whole damn lot of us were sittin right square on the road At early noon we sat on a silvered log and ate our sandwiches dry You leave when day after tomorrow Yes Scared any of the plane ride Some You know Im like Grandma on that leery about heights His instant slant of grin As the fellow says Doig337 what if you get up in that thing and it comes urtcrartked up there Thanks a whole helluva lot for the idea I was up in one once ye know Nothin1 to it Disbelief as if hed said hed once been to Afghanistan When the hell was that When I was a punk kid about your age at a rodeo or a fair or some kind of doins A guy had one of them planes with wings top and bottom and hed take ye up for a little ride Angus and I bet each other five dollars about goin up and were both so damn Scotch we didnt want to lose that money I went first I was the oldest That guy turned that plane every which way Im here to tell ye Well how was it Angus says If ye see my stomach up there I says bring it back down with ye Youre a world of encouragement I pitched a stone at a snag below us on the slope What about after this Air Force business Are ye gonna be able to look for a job out here I faced around to him slowly as if the motion hurt Dad I dont think so The jobs for me just arent here I think Im pretty much gone from this country I figured ye were My fathers straight cleanJined face broke open in a tearful gulp the wrenched gasp I had seen all the years ago in the weeks after my mothers death r Doig 338 I helplessly looked aside swallowed pulled at my lower lip with my teeth I heard the breech of the 22 snick open saw Dad palm the tiny cartridge out and finger it into the shell box His face was steady and square again Dont say anything to your Grandma yet Shell miss ye enough these next months without knowin beyond that J Listen up you rainbows Still in civilian clothes after five days of basic training I stood rigid with the others in the motley chow line as if we were the arrest lineup in a precinct station The first days cropped haircut seemed to have put years on me for every hair it lopped off I was being called Old Man in the barracks as if I were an ancient Sioux chief You will be marched to draw military issue at hours in the morning Thats uniforms garbageheads and you smell like you need em The San Antonio weather was blistering endofSeptember days blazing hotter than Montanas July Sweat had soaked in white stains across my shoes Did I tell anybody in this here line to be at ease Hah Answer up you bald dipstick Octobers fourth week 1962 On Monday evening 7 oclock San Antonio time someone in the barracks produced a transistor radio a dozen of us hunched in to listen to the presidential speech announcing a naval blockade of Cub until the Russian Doig 339 missiles were taken from the next morning even some of the training sergeants looked scared Others looked ecstatic On the rifle range bothered with having to use a peep sight instead of the open sight I had grown up with I shot worse than some of the recruits who had never touched a trigger before A sergeant dressed down several of us with the most miserable scores The only way you yoyos are gonna git yourselves a Cuban is by chunking the damn rifle at him ff This day and the next the rumors ran up and down the prism of possibility and off the ends Straight skinny on this Cuba was going to be invaded Troops on the far side of the base already were clambering into planes destined for Florida First Sarge Evacuation was corning We would Got it from the be planedFfno of the giant missile bullseye that was Lackland Air Force Base In the midst of the flustered reports the base went to condition three alert just short of warlfthursday on the obstacle course a sergeant with a seamed face used our rest break to fill in the you people on this Cuba Whats happened now see is this United Nations general whos got a name about this longspreading his hands three feet apart to estimate the mysteries of U proposed a parlyuhrnent to consider the situation Pause Myself I hope they consider in a quick hurry and o in and mow over them spies Friday as Khrushchev and Kennedy Doig 340 bargained everyones fate we were marched across the base for vaccinations Showing off in front of a dozen other platoons our drill sergeant gave us by the right flank MARCH and watched in horror as half of us ricocheted left His bleated helpless fury was almost welcome at least it seemed the safest behavior of the past five daysfwe went into the weekend and came out with the world undemolished The powers thatwere had decided not to push their final buttons For now After San Antonio the training school in northern Texas was like a halfcoma full of skewed hours and uncertain seasons and dodgy behavior A snowstorm lashed in from the south after a lifetime of Montanas blizzards from west and north I could not have been more surprised if the snow had flown up out of the ground or sideways out of trees A barracksmate from Houston came beside me as I looked out the window to the fat fresh snow Thet Yankee rain is startin to pile up aint it An article adapted from my thesis was accepted by a scholarly quarterly after lightsout one night I corrected the proofs for it in the latrine The Air Force had scanned my college degrees in journalism and eslotted me to become a propell r repairman We marched off to a hangar to class before dawn stood blearily behind our desks for the first hour or so to stay awake One lanky Doig 341 seventeenyearold could doze standing up Im real sorry sir he offered with a yawn when caught for the third time of the morning Youre sorry all right the instructor said in wonder youre about the sorriest sumbitch I ever did see Each afternoon we were adrift on the base I found the base library discovered that sergeants who would have stormed place IvoJima with a cheese parer come near the orr1ve In Grandmas Christmas package a calendar from her son in Australia I cut out the fine color photo of a wombat pasted it inside my locker door and explained to puzzled young enlistees from the South that the fuzzy creatures roamed the Montana hills just like you have possums My daddy caught and tamed this one We named him Grommet Yup Grommet the wombat Day and night B52s made their slow roar over us seeming to hang in the air like orbiting battleships I wondered by what miracle they were made to climb into flight I had not yet found enough efficiency in the military to launch a silk handkerchief in a high wind The months crept By instinct I hung at of the system dodged duties when I could and doubled down to endurance when I had to I was not a good soldier nor a poor one I was the usual fuel of historys armies the timeServing soldier Doig 342 Ringling dozed in its lateMarch bath of mud Except that Mike Ryans store stood hollow and socketed with broken windows and that Dad had built a plank sidewalk from the doorway around to the woodhouse and outhouse the town looked exactly as when Grandma and I had begun unstacking boxes there a dozen years before I stood at the kitchen window looking downslope to the depot1 gray and a deeper I had stepped from the train an hour before Spot nosed my ankle for the thirtieth time plunged into comfortable collapse beneath the table I said too casually I think Im going to take that Decatur job I looked at on the way back from Texas Grandma Ohhh Her smallest siren of disapproval Now Dad Ye think so son What does something like that pay One hundred tw ve dollars a week more than half what he earned in a month at ranch work Grandma Whatd you be doing there then Writing editorials What are they like Rose Gordon writes in the paper when anybody dies I tried to explain editorials Too deep for me boy Dad Thats a better wage than you can get anywhere around here thats for damn sure Nothing said for a minute Then Grandma How long of vacations do you get to come home Doig343 Decatur was a city of 80000 amid the dark wealth of soil which the glacial era had buttered across central Illinois Fat fields of corn and soybeans surged from the earth and overspilled crops which seemed to me the agriculture of another planett and Decatur had made itself the merchant city for the farmingsea which surrounded it Large enough to have a beginning of urban manners and woes but insular enough to know it could never outcrowd bigger Springfield to its west or ChampaignUrbana to its east the community was a good training stop for young climbers The Caterpillar corporation seasoned executives at the tractor factory there before moving them on and up fledgling store managers mastered inventories at the local Woolworth and Penneys as the step to grander merchandising earnest ministers polished their repertoires beforebeing east to higher pulpits And the LindsaySchuab newspaper chain which had its headquarters in Decatur held a reputation for working its newcomers thoroughly but fairly giving them a bit of leeway to show talent then losing them to bigger publications Which was my quick career there exactly Somewhere I had read of a newsman who liked to preen that he could write faster than anybody who was better and better than anybody who was faster and that skimming waterbug pace was where I pointed myself in Decatur Our editorial page staff of seven Doig344 had endless call for our operated newspapers not only in Decatur but in the university towns all across central and southern Illinois and the management saw itself in a sober stance of and after a few weeks I found that I could write four editorials a day deft and unoffending skitters across Algeriathe Pentagon civil other issues of 1963 and early 1964 and still have time to do page layout Sunday feature pieces and study Dave Felts for lessons in Downstate elegance Before coming over to Decatur and ending up as editor of the editorial page Dave had been a newspaperman in Springfield when Vachel Lindsay yet was writing and performing his poems there and he could be counted on for occasional ironic thumpy recitations from the old rhymester I brag and chant of Bryan Bryan BryanCandidate for president who sketched a silver Zion This and all else was said in apparent easy contentment and out of the most dimming affliction a newspaperman could suffer for years Dave had been fighting blindness and with operation after operation pushed it back until he could work as zestfully as ever bringing our sheafs of editorial copy up close to his dizzying glasses bending interestedly close over his desk to nick out an occasional word with his editing pencil Not least because he had his own abundance Dave liked style in a person he kept on a shrineshelf in his office Doig 345 the delicate martini glass of his predecessor an offhand editorial wizard named Sam Tucker who was remembered for heading off to the backshop at each deadline a dab of copy in one hand and scissors in the other and by the time he arrived there would have snipped guest editorials from other papers until his own page filled exactly My with Dave Felts shot up when he learned that I was carrying on a courtship in away One more grandeur of the big town is she I was convinced so She was Carol Muller whom I had met when we both worked in teachingandcounseling summer journalism sessions at Northwestern a few years before A trim steadyeyed brunette of definite opinions and cleanedged talents Carol now had traded in an East Coast newspaper job for a magazine editorship in a Chicago suburb We rellet just as I had begun jobshopping beyond Decatur I already was finding that I lacked instinct for the deep waters of newspapering Amid the nightmare which began loosing itself in a November noon1 the words Kennedy and shot seeping up from the hubbub of the lunchplace the scrambling return to the newspaper building and the flood unrolling out of DallasMI noticed that I was both exhilarated and sickened neither of which seemed the most professional of responses On a basis I savored more the Dave Felts announcement of a new face angled in my doorway in blinking search habemus papem enunciated in somber Downstate Doig 346 the shift which presented FtCliilb in yards of words Assessing myself when jobs came open to me in New York and Washington newsrooms I mulled briefly and would not make the step What I did instead was to begin writing to magazine editors and almost at once hit on an opening at The Rotarianfout of alL the world in Evanston a few blocks from where I had entered Northwestern six years before I put first among the sheaf of writing samples asked for by The Rotarian editor what I had slammed out on the day of Dinah Washingtons death The lady sang the blues And lived them That I considered would be something for a gentlemanly serviceclub magazine to start a decision on Rapidly I was flown in for an interview and hired In mid1964 a few days past my twentyfifth birthday I became an assistant editor of a magazine of 400000 circulation One person alone was the greater audience than that I spent hour upon hour with Carol and saw her in my mind the rest of the time Our backgrounds could not have been more had grown up in a turreted New Jersey resort town which seemed to me as antique and daft as I imagined Lichtenstein must be4yet friends remarked how much we were like each other Alike it turned out down to the deepest exactnessesrin having been wary of the commitments of mating Doig347 in surprising ourselves now with the quickness of emotion for each other in deciding promptly to be married Two pairs of lives now half a continent and a timezone apart Carol and I mail to Montana the bylined articles we turn out Dad thrusts them onto all visitors and Grandma eventually jumbles them into one or another of her makeshift albums While Carol and I leave our Evanston apartment each morning on her commute to the Together offices and mine to The Rotarian Grandma is clearing away the dishes after the breakfast she has put on the long table at the Higgins ranch As I prop my feet on the desk to read manuscripts Dad will be starting work in the shed muttering his hesyours yewalleyedoldsister formula to make the cows mother their purebred calves When I break for lunch walking to whatever greenery I can think of to eat my sandwiches amid Dad kicks off his overshoes at the cookhouse door takes the cup of coffee Grandma is handing him delivers his latest curses of thatgoddamngeezerofaJeff As Carol works the phone to arrange the story assignment waiting for her in San Francisco or Atlanta Grandma is setting the table for the ranch crews lunch As I dictate lateafternoon letters to authors Grandma may be in her midafternoon round to gather the eggs scolding Spot for his interest in a corral post When I leave my office at the stroke of five she has begun to cook supper Doig348 for the ranch crew the color of the sage hills has begun to deepen The four lives mix richly in Carols first visit to Montana The first night in the house in Ringling Grandma departs at bedtime to spend the night at the Badgetts Dad takes her place on the livingroom couch Carol and I take his in the bed in the tiny bedroom Ah burrs my fathers voice through the quiet to us as the fellow says this is the place to be when night comes We wake in the morning to a bell jangling close outside the window Carol starts Whats that I ponder for her benefit Mmm could be sheep or a goat Or somebodys milk cow Or a horse Probably not a chicken itd have trouble dragging the bell around She looks out the window All right its a horse She gives me a grin of love and disbelief It widens as the front door is clattered open Spot explodes in and instantly has his head onto the bededge us Grandma cheerily is announcing Hi you in there getting up today And in the next year the set of decisions which lifted Carol and me westward that we had had enough of the mountainless Midwest and of jobs we could do with Doig 349 automatic skills I had come to feel that if I was going to go through life as bookish as I was I well bend with the inclination and become a professor No sooner had I said so than Carol said Lets go do it4The University of Washington accepted me into graduate study In the late summer of 1966 Carol and I arrived in Seattle set out at once to walk its hills and shores and to explore into the mountain ranges scarped along the entire horizons east and west of the city We were on new ground of the continent and stretched gratefully to it And then as quick as this we learned that now we were on another ground in life as well my father had begun to die Doig350 story more out of memory times and never enough heard from my father a hundred It was along about 1935 Your mother and I were herdin sheep just then at the old D L place Jobs was scarce in those days You had to take anything you could get Well a damned bear got to comin in to the ranch there killin sheep Boy hed kill em right and left Hed always wait till after the moon went down till it got good and dark All the neighbors thered be some of em there pretty near every night with me to try get that bear but we never could Your Uncle Paul he came down there The two of us were gonna spend the night in an old log barn there The loft end of it was open and we were gonna get old mister bear for sure This bear now hed just kill his sheep and leave em lay thats the way a bear does They dont like fresh meat they like it after it gets spoiled So we got one of the first sheep hed killed up on the hill and drug it down there to bait him down there under that loft ye see We both swore we never slept a wink but that night that bear ate the whole sheep within thirty feet of us and we never knew it We went on not havin any luck that way Generally all wed see would be the bears eyes as hed take off out of there in the dark This one evening Berneta1Lyour mother I Doig 351 me and the neighbor Mrs Christison were sittin there in the front room of the house It had big windows and the house sat up on a knoll we could see down to where the sheep were bedded in just below We didnt corral em we didnt darefthat beard get into em and pile em up and ikill half of em at once So I heard the sheep bells aringin and I looked out the window and here comes the whole band right towards the house That bear was after em I grabbed the have a very good rifle either just an old brokendown one I had loaded and sittin went back through the dining room through the kitchen and sneaked out the back door I got out behind the bunkhouse Then theres a creek there with heavy willows I was gonna get on the edge of them and sneak around behind the bear I thought Id sure fix that boy this time I got about halfway to the brush and I looked up and here he had a sheep cut out right against the house wall Theres a pole fence come up and nailed right onto the corner of the house and he was trying to catch this sheep in there The radio was again and your mother and Mrs Christison were standin there in the window just like that watchin I cut down on him with that old rifle and he went WOOF I dont know if I hit him or not but I changed his mind anyhow Doig352 Well he either had to come toward me or go right back through the middle of the sheep so here he comes toward me He got oh about sixty feet from me and he was gonna head around the edge of the sheep then I cut down on him again and I know I hit him that He let another WOOF out of him and he was mad now he comes He had his old head turned sidewise I could have counted his teeth there in the moonlight I never give it a thoughtto run Anyhow he got up oh pretty close Id say about here to that window six feet or so I was tryin to shoot him between the eyes He had his head turned a little bit and I got him rightJryou know the way a bears head is his ears are up towards the top of his headkI got him right the side of the ear there The bullet went down through his neck and all the way into his lungs That took the WOOF out of him Sat him back on his haunches and he made a pass at me and I ducked him as he come around or hed of ripped me in four pieces Just as he went by I jammed the gun against his ribs right behind his shoulder there and cut loose on him again WOOF he says again and away he went cfTJiJilMateitltlcl91Jik I Jtlililiil Qiil He ha d to go ab o u t thirty feet there till he hit a brandnew fourwire fence Doig 353 with cedar posts He tore out about a hundred yards of that fence when he hit it He went across the creek into the brush and boy he was cuttin up in there groanin and growlin and tearin up the brush I looked up and heres Mrs Christison and your mother standing right on the bank above me Theyd been there all the time while I was shootin at him And one of em had a lantern I dont know what they were gonna do with that lantern the Mrs Christison had this other old gun that was in house She says You got any shells left I says Yeah I got some in my pocket 1 thatd been the last shell I had in the gun when I put it again him there Well she says Mrs Christison says lets go in and get him You can go in and get him I says Ive had enough of him So we waited a little bit It was all quieted down in the brush there and I knew hes either dead or gone So we went down the creek a little ways theres a bridge there and come up where the brush wasnt so thick He was layin there in a heap of brush dead I didnt get scared during it never gave a thought to run when that bear was comin at me But I shook all night afterwards after it was all over Doig 354 A hundred times told and always that last lilt of wonder in his voice that he could have been both hunter and hunted
