 Doig 144 LADY G1 sitting up in a railroad coach seat for a day a night and another day Bessie Ringer is jostled westward in the of 1914 The Mississippi River lay several hundreds of miles behind vaulted by a slim bridge which had made her flick scared glances down to the gliding water all the long way over Minnesota had been crossed and the Dakotas where the homesteads of an earlier generation of journeyers nested in fat patches of turned earth Rivers new and wild to herthe Little Missouri the Powder the YellowstoneJ came looping widely beneath the roadbed and now when the Doig145 train made its wheezy stops in the middle of nowhere the men who clomped aboard wore hats with swooping curled brims and their women she could not help but notice looked leathered from the sun and wind Where they stepped from the arc of prairie flung straight and empty to the horizon nothing could be imagined which might rule their lives except that sun that wind By the time then that her train was pushing out of the townless distances of eastern Montana Bessie had come an entire world away from the pinched midwestern background she had been born into twenty years before Come whats more for forever and with no regret ever said aloud Her people back there were German stock abrupt and gloomy as their family name Glun MIn the memories which stretched along the rails to the farmstead life in central Wisconsins cutover pine country that name mocked itself into queer rhyme It had happened because school dismayed Bessie and in her unhappiness one day was caught whispering to Ring up his pointer to threaten her the girl seated beside he teacher thundered it Glun Glun dont have so much fun or youll have a swat of Jack Hickorys son At home life was no less startling and strict under her burly mustached father I always remember my pa so stern I was always scared of him Now train tracks hour upon hour were leaving always to the past to the land falling away behind the West Doig 146 On Bessies lap a daughter dozes in the trains cradling motion my mother Bernetawaking now and again to see the land flying and flying past her sixmonthold eyes She is plump and pretty and with her full dark hair has begun to look like a small jolly version of a much older girl A version that would be of Bessie herself not long before On the wall by me is a studio portrait of Bessie when she had reached the age of sixteen or so posed with the two Krebs sisters who were her best of friends Out the oval window of photo the sisters stare down the camera and any lookers beyond it mouths straight as Bible lines You would not tease with this pair not dare their wrath without an open door behind you They are iron and granite side by side and are going to leave some bruises on the world Beside them Bessies look is all the softer the eyes more open and asking her face wondering at life instead of taking it on chinrfirst She must have had much to wonder at raised as such an apronstringed girl snuggled all the more firmly into the family by the one lapse in her fathers strictness John Glun had brooded against a way of schooling which even for an instant could taunt a daughter of his and after her third year Bessie was not made to attend again She spent the rest of her growing years entirely at home That upbringing Doig J47 of choring for her mother and edging past her fathers thunde head temper left her unsure of herself but guessing that the world must have something else to offer So thats the how of it she would say whenever some new turn of life had shown itself and she seemed about to say it there to the camera eye It is all in all an offering glance for the world of which she might yet have had a strong gleam four years later as she held her prized daughter and watched the western Montana mountains begin to stand high ahead of the train Alongside Bessie the train window shadowing his face close in beside hers sits Thomas Abraham Ringer Housepainter handyman wiry Irishman with a hatchet nose and a chin like an axelast and least husband All three Glun children N flew as quickly as they could from that narrow home but Bessie went with one last disfavor from her father He singled out for her this Tom Ringer and bent her at the age of 18 into marrying the man Gee gosh a girl like I was who didnt know her own mind I done it because my pa said it was my way to get by in the world Tom was twice her age nearly as old as her father himself and the one thing he had done exactly right in all his life until been not to take on a wife and a family In fair charitylonehalf of those who speak of Tom Ringer Doig148 do give a rough affectionate forgiveness while the other half call him something like a sourminded reprobateMthe knack of caring unswervingly for anyone beyond himself did not seem to be in this man Alone fussing a floorboard into place or stroking a paintbrush peevishly along a ceiling that sharp face could simply prod all into tidiness and spear away whatever of life he did not want to see or hear But being married was nothing like being alone and there came the consequence which Bessie declared in the shortest and angriest of her verdicts on this husband Tom drank It made a dubious marriage worse The temper tamped inside Tom which he seemed to need to propel himself through life would turn ugly when whiskey touched it Darn his hide Hed be going along perfectly fine then thered be a big This too even when his trickle away in saloons they shrank and vanished some other way All their married life Tom and Bessie Ringer would live close to predicament The one feat of finance they ever managed was this train trip uprooting themselves half a continent westward to where a relative had homesteaded a blind f I jump to the strange high country of sage and silence At the town of Three Forks they left the train There the broad tilts of this new country suddenly tumbled three idling rivers into one another to greaten into the headwaters of the Missouri and in every direction around ranges of Doig 149 mountains hazed to a thin blue as if behind smoke Mountains and mountains and mountains Bessie would remembercUThe promise of a housepainters job awaited Tom in this first town of the new life But that job or any other wasnt to be had What did present itself was the rumor of work at a small logging camp eastward in the Crazy Mountains See Tom had been in the woods some back in went off up there near Porcupine Creek in the Crazies and Tom cut in the timber until winter comeJThen into the teeth of the mountain weather Tom and Bessie and their tiny daughter climbed higher into the Crazies to spend the winter cutting small trees for fence posts Some thousands of feet higher than they had ever been in their Wisconsin lives they set up a peaked photographers tent in the dark pitch of forest banked the outside walls with snow for warmth fired up a longbox stove which would be kept blazing all winter long and whacked down timber from first light to last No it wasnt so bad of a winter We got by good there was worlds of firewood Through that timberland winter isolated and snowbound Bessie and Tom felled and unlimbed trees then snaked the wood to a snowpacked skidway She would clamber down the slope as Tom hitched their workhorse to the first pile of logs and looped the reins to the harness The horse would plod down to in the snow her the logs sledding long soft troughs behind the load the horse would I Doig 150 turn tself back up the mountain for the next load of work That pattern of trudge was much like what lay ahead for Bessie herself for if I am to read any beginnings at all in these lives which twine behind my own my grandmothers knack for ploughing through all hardship surely begins here at the very first of these lean Montana years Then the kids banished Tom to that in later times his name never crossing her tongue if she could help it111the kids dad got us on at Moss Agate The rancher ran a herd of cull milk cows there and we milked all those cows and put up the hay on the place We lived there oh a lot of vears Moss Agate was a small ranch at the southern reach of the Smith River valley on an empty flat furred with sage and a few hackles of brush along the South Fork of the river lH oot1t111s and walled in at every point of the horizon by buttes The single vivid thing about the place lay in its name The rock called moss agate is a stone a smokey hardness with its trapped black shadow of fossil inside like a tree dancing to the wind or a sailing ship defying fog or whatever else from it Later after my father had begun to court my mother someone who Agate asked saw him saddling for his weekly ride to Moss if he was finding any the hills there One he grinned Shes about five feet tall Doig151 with black hair and blue eyes On that ranch where dreams were trapped in rock Bessie and Tom milked cows year after year toiled to keep the few sunbrowned ranch buildings from yawning into collapse and plodded out their marriage There was a new child now every few boys in a row Each summer Bessie held M the latest baby in her lap as she drove a team of horses hitched to the sulkyseated hay rake I wore bib overalls then in haying time But silly thing Id run and put a dress on if I seen anybody corning Throughout the seasons she rode horseback after strayed calves fed hogs raised chickens gardened and canned burned out the sage ticks which pincered the children mucked out the tidal flow of manureandurine after the eternal cows And all of it in a growing simmer against Torn I can watch her in those Moss Agate years being made over from almost all that she had been before toughening leathering the salt of sweat going into her mind and heart Even her body now defied the harsh life the single luxury of that milking herd was dairy produce and as her cooking feasted on the unending butter and cream she broadened and squaredtlBut it was her look to the world that most and in the few photos from about her thirtieth year her tenth in Montana a newcomer now gazes out from where the young bride had beenLa f linchless newcomer who has firmed M Doig 152 into what she will be all the rest of her life Her face now was strongest almost mighty at its the careful clasp of a mouth which seemed alway eady center n to purse with no relenting and the thick nose which has monumented itself all through the family line to her A brief ball of chin a fine square span of forehead beneath neatly waved hair already gone gray and on its way to white Blue eyes paler and more flat in their declaring than say my fathers mulling look She stood to the height my mother does in photographtk scant inches over five feet but where my mother seemed a wand M of a woman this grandmother was an oak stump Chunky as she had times weighing more than 150 pounds and long since locked into an everlasting lost battle her own pastries snacks and second helpings1she somehow seemed without being steady without being stolid1f rn this odd strong way then her very made her appear taller than she really was and a neighbors memory at last explained The first time I remember seeing Bessie Ringer was at the Caukins schoolhouser at a dance out there and I just admired her so she always carried herself so straight and dignified Of course so straight and the dignity of that For in both senses of the saying Bessie Ringer was erect pride and the unbending notions to go with it In a Doig 153 sense the central ideas in her were lodged in place like the logs of a sharply pointed and as durable as they were wooden The first of her unattackable beliefs was family This had started early when my mother from her first breaths was seen to be an asthma victim and Bessie began to raise her with a special blend of love and fuss It went on as each of her three boys arrived musical Paul and mischievous M William and adept Wallace1and were given whatever sacrifices she could that they would be able to go through the schooling she had not make it out into life whole and able We had to get by sometimes on a lick and a promise but theres others didnt do as good as we managed too That the family thinned off markedly at Toms end of the table simply redoubled her affections was as if his portion of her commitment had to be put to use somehow and into the children it went Next came work Bessie was uncomfortable with much depth of thinkingJher slim school years and that tethered M girlhood had robbed her mind there and she knew it with doing came to her ease She worked that is to say as some people singrror the pleasure of it the habit of it the sense that life was asking it specially of her It gives me the willies she would recite to be si ttin just doin nothin In her own retelling and all told about her I can find her at almost every relentless ranch task of those years stacking hay teamstering horses Doig 154 in dead winter pulling calves from breech births stringing barbed wire onto fencelines threshing grain amid the itching storm of chaff axing ice from the cattles wateringholes She was a worker comes the valleys echo of her again and again So much a worker it may be that items such as a wrong husband fell away behind the pace of task and chore Family workJand the clinch across both of them steady fastness Life was to be lived out as it came If it came hard you bowed your neck a bit more and endured So without thinking it throughJnot entirely knowing how toin iUl wzr4 J she had set her mind not to be afraid of that spare weatherwhipped Jand that wan ranch life4 In this total rind of determination Bessie was not like many of the valley women or most of the men either Down through the valleys history such settlers had expected something of their work and sooner or later uprooted themselves if it didnt come Bessie only chored on In her unschooled way she was greatly more fearless about wresting a fresh life in Montana than my fathers family had been the Basin had allied themselves formed a kind of trestle of relatives and fellow Scots Compared with them Bessie went along as alone and unaided as a tumbleweedlf Indeed her stories of life at Moss Agate of other hard scrabble spots in the valley most often began with the aloneness The one time I was alone by myself on the place the kids Doig 155 dad was off again somewherekand it rained and it rained until the creek started to come up around the cattle in the corral It kept coming and kept coming until I had to saddle our old roany horse and ride through Jllto let those cows out The over and of course that old roany made it his habit to stop dead whenever you tried to hurry him But I got him through the water and tied one end of the rope to the pole gate and the other end to the saddle horn and the cows could follow me out then A person can do a lot of things like that when youre in a corner But a corner of another sort was where Tom loomed in his private furies and if steadfastness held her into thyarriage and the ranch life it did not overcome the pains of them Gone to town for groceries Tom might not return fDr days When he did come back from such sprees he arrived rasping at the way Bessie had done the ranch chores or was raising the children Gosh sakes times you wouldnt know he was a man youd ever met Orneri old thing him anyhow She began to fight back at him with silence and she could be as grimly silent as oblivion Thenthe rancher who owned Moss Agate died and passed from the valley with a storied funeral where whiskey oozed through the flower smells and the reek of pallbearers nearly dropped the coffin at the graveside Whiskey had poisoned Bessies life at Moss Agate and now Doig 156 whiskey closed it She and Tom and the four children moved to another ranch That job lasted no timelit was in the 11 deep of the Depression nowand soon they were in the tiny railline town of Ringling in a ragtag house which at least put shelter atop their heads Sometime then Tom left Bessie alone again with the teetery household and at last she broke the marriage She never bothered with a divorce Going to law for something which she had ended in her own mind did not seem needed But TomLrather the kids dadhad passed from her M as surely as if he had been tumbled into the grave with the whiskeyfied rancher That life done Bessie was soon adrift There was no income and the last of the children were out of school and heading off on their own In Shields River Valley the Crazy Mountains where she had started in Montana twenty q five years before she found a job as cook for an elderly farmer named Magnusson He was prosperous but lonely a widower feeling old and trying to dilute his days with drink When the drinking and the selfpity tapered away entirely on her and they became a familiar pair in the Shields River country he driving her in his black pickup to a meeting of her womens club or off to the town of Wilsa11 for the weeks groceries she ruling in his kitchen and handling the farmyard chores for him Doig 157 the sight of them constantly paired set tongues it took less than thatAbut they confounded the gossips conside 1 ably No one ever managed to hear them call each other anything but Mr Magnusson and Mrs Ringer or to see them more than correctly cordial with one another maintaining an austere arrrs length household it was all but impossible to read anythi3 into suspicion fairly quickly Bessie became fast friends with some of the sternest neighboring wives and a wellregarded member of the Shields River community Which left just one person on a moral high horse against her My father The resentment between Dad and my grandmother must have circled in darkly from the past all the way from his earliest courting of my mother Lessons of lineage were not something Bessie Ringer ordinarily gave much thought to But as she watched this only daughter her first child and the ill one and the favored being wooed by a showy young cowboy surely her own marriage to Tom Ringer came to mind and probably too her mothers marriage to the stern silent John Glun What was said there in the years of my fathers courtship as Bessie tried to stave off the pasts rhythm I have never heard hinted But the broad line of time tells much It was only a few months before my mothers twentyfirst birthday when by law she would have been free of family consent that Doig 158 she and my father were married after six entire years of courtship From all that I can deduce there was no open rift while my mother remained alive My grandmothers sense of family likely stormed over past differences In the marriage summer when my mother and father were herding sheep on Grass Mountain Bessie would get on a saddlehorse at Ringling ride half a day north across the sage prairie and somehow search them out along the lengthy mountain slope After overnight she would saddle and ride off to appear again in a few weeks as if having strolled across the street If Dad was my mothers choice in life so be it for Bessie He had become Family and she would become civil And when I was born her first grandchild and the sole one for a space of years her visiting became heartier yet Oh I used to come and stay with you while your folks was to a dance in Sixteen or Rinsling They had themselves a time there and we had ourselves one to home we did But after my mothers death something quickly hung in the air between my father and my grandmother like the first blazing word of a secret and no more She made a few uneasy visits to us at our first ranch in the valley But she and Ruth were enemies almost at sight and when Dad married Ruth we abruptly were visited by my grandmother no a reversal of sorts began as if something were being acted Doig 159 out before angled sets of mirrors Dad now encouraged me to go across town after school to visit my grandfather Tom Ringer Allavthis to my father there was charity as well as defiance in this turnabout notion of his At the time I was Tom Ringers only grandchild and dour as his life may have been he showed an old mans gruff affection for me He lived then in a small cabin across the street from the sulphur slough and made his slow rounds uptown each day I remember he was quite worried about you my firstgrade teacher would recall to me many years later in those months just after iou had lost our mother Whenever Id meet him on the street hed inquire about how you were getting along did all too little to return his interest He was by then into his seventies a bent and grayfaced man with a colossal blade of nose living lonely in a musty cabin and I was not entirely sure where his life cornered onto mine Grandparents in general seemed a difficult proposition Those on Dads side of the family who sounded wondrously interesting in their Scottishness long since were gone from the world and here on my mothers side were this warring grandmother and this weary wraith of a grandfather The only clear fact in it all seemed to be something Dad said Its hell on old Tom left alone with himself Beyond that visiting maneuver Dad began to try to talk 9kmeJand himselflinto forgetting Bessie Ringer And at Doig160 the same time I suppose to chant himself into a rightness about what he was doing for along with all else borne in him since my mothers death he had been living with twin fears The first that he would lose me somehow be unable to keep me with him and raise me amid his zigzagging ranch life Second and worse that if he was forced to give me up it would have to be to the he had been at spearpoint with so much of the past life It must have represented the last loss possible to his that his one son would be made a stranger to A tried to twine his other bereavement onto that one as if he could knot together from the two a talisman of some sort Your mother would of wanted me to raise you instead of your Grandma doing it I can tell ye that She said she said just as much She talked about it sometimes after shed had one of her bad spells We always knew she might go during one of those spellszkchristamightt how suffered with those Times I would drive her to the hospital in Townsend thinking every breath was be her last She went through hell on this earth iour mother And she never would want me to give you up from him then A lf A the next veer from fear to spite Hell well get bt somehow son We dont need that old woman running our lives Look at her there living with old Magnusson that wax and never marrying him She needs to run her own life more pert Id say Doig 161 Then this the rest of the secret told Shed take you from me in a minute if she could But theres no way on this green earth Im gonna let her But there was a way and it came with a slow fierce sear inside him during our summer of 1950 at the cattle camp along Sixteenmile Creek Dad began to suspect that he might be dying For several years he had been contending with a fitful stomach ulcer during Ruths years it embered more often in him and now had glowed itself into a steady burn It became a rare day when he didnt throw up at least one meal He lost weight his nerves jumped Everything the doctors prescribed seemed to make the stomach worse and their obvious bafflement gave off the fear that this finally was more than an ulcer on a rampageeJFor the first time mortality was crowding Charlie Doig slowly enough that he could think it through and across that charring summer it brought him to the greatest change of mind he could make He needed someone in readiness to step into his place in my readiest person on the face of the planet was the one who had loomed in his dark musingstehis while A to gulp back then when he set out to make truce with this phantom grandmother of mine I can hear as if in a single clear echo the pivoting of our lives right there Dad beginning his desperate phone call in the lobby of the Sherman Hotel spelling out her name in an embarrassed halfshout to the operator staring miserably at the cars nosing off around the prow of the hotel as the Doig 162 longdistance line hummed and howled in his ear Then Ah Hullo Bessie This is Charlie Charlie Charlie Doig No Ivans fine fine hes right here Ah Say would ye gonna be home on Sunday We could ah come over maybe and see ye All right All right then Gbye The Hagnusscn farm in the county south of us lay in what we called the Norskie coverlet of farmed M slopes and creek bottoms coming down along the watershed of the Shields River from the icy snaggled peaks of the Crazy Mountains It was better growing country than our valleylower the Norwegian immigrants were exactly thrifty and stubborn people to make it pay After her years at the sage flats of Moss Agate my grandmothers job at Magnussons must have seemed almost silken As we drove to his farm the furrowed fields were ruled straight and brown on one side of the road the green flow of hayfields curving with the creek on the other Magnussons like a cliff and creeks slim house brown as the plowed earth came out the slope which led down into valley e H f i ks part Se ilied to he a eene1 c be gr As we Doig 163 tie sH r went u a man and a woman stepped onto the lofty porch and with curiosity Magnusson proved to be a steady eyed stocky farmer in his seventies with white eyebrows and a mustache stained considerably less than white His rumbled accent came like a growl against Dads burr but he said we were welcome in his house always then withdrew to the front room with his newspaper from NorwayJThat left us with my grandmother whom I barely remembered from three or so years before She gave Dad a thin Hello beamed down at me and said Wheres a kiss for your grarnrna I pecked her cheek and husked a Hello as close as I could to the tone she had given Dad The three of us bunched ourselves at the table in the vast kitchen serious visiting was done in As she and I munched our way I through a plate of cookieiiAid l1EottghL Dad lit cigarettes nervously and between puffs chewed away at the inside of his cheek In a fashion he was courting this wary woman much as he had courted her daughter twenty years earlier but with grimness instead of love What was unspoken but being said more plainly than anything in his careful this We need you I may die soon Ivan must have someone to raise him How much the old rift between them was mended that Sunday I do not know I was too young to read the presence of the Doig 164 past although I could sense it was somehow there in the kitchen with us both of these figures could in some yesterday that first visit surely undid some of the anger just by not becoming a brawl I remember I went out with her ll to feed the white geese in the farmyard and that they hissed and flounced around us until her dog Shep came barking delirious to have an excuse to scatter the bullies Shoo em Shep I remember her encouraging in a kind of angry pleasure Shoo em good Sic em out of here the goshdarn old fools I remember too that by the time Dad and I left I was calling her Grandma For his part DadAseemed not to know what to call his own motherinlaw He calling her anything at all during our kitchen stay But from the bottom of the stairs he finally said up to her Well come Areh tle again next Sunday Almost every weekend after that we would o I Magnussons to visit her The bargain Dad needed was being forged It would take effect sooner than even he dreamed because one among us in that odd group was dying all right but it was not my father It was Martin Magnusson Just before old Magnusson slumped into the series of hospital stays which saw him decline to death Dad bluntly asked my grandmother further into his plan The doctoring Doig165 in Montana was not helping him his stomach flamed more and more now he felt himself growing weaker He was going to a place in Minnesota called the Mayo Clinic and he wanted not to go alone to have me with him and her Would she come M In a week the three of us stepped up into the eastbound train at Ringling I remember of the trip only that Dad wearily slept and slept and that when Grandma drowsed with her head back against the coach seat she sometimes snorted herself awake with a long kkkhhh of a snore and that I abandoned the pair of them to sit by the hour in the car and watch the worldscape of my first train journey At the destination in Minnesota Dad hardly had the strength to carry a suitcase into the hotel where we would stay He checked into the clinic and immediately the doctors began days of tests on him Grandma and I watched the people below from our hotel room far above the street and spent time with Dad at the clinic whenever he was not in testson the fourth day we were startled by a telegram for Grandma Tom Ringer had died His last torment of my grandmother was that she still felt something for him which made her want to return to Montana for his funeral Dad agreed there was no choice although it seemed to me there was all the choice inthe world She and I took the train back to Montana leaving Dad to the doctors solemn tests After the funeral I went to stay again with Dads brother Doig 166 Angus and his family Grandma returned to Magnussons farm Several weeks dragged by before Dad followed us home to Montana and when he came he was ghost with only a third of his stomach That severe surgery alone could keep him alive the doctors had told hJf1 and he would not be able to do any work for many months JfThere the doctors had the matter backwards hat ability was left in had hired on at a ranch at the western edge of the valley and there pale and retching if he ate a spoonful too much at any mealtime my father began slamming away at the job as he always had And he arranged a second matter as much against the odds as the first Grandma and I now were to live in Ringling in the shambled small house where she had managed to put her own children through school and out into the world From there I would ride the bus to school in White Sulphur Springs this part of life changed But under a new roof with ell 41 J restoredijiwruiH16t13 almo t all else did A That Ringling lay on the land twenty miles to the south of White Sulphur Springs as the imprint of what had been a town like the yellowed outline on grass after a tent has been taken down When the roadbed of the Milwaukee and St Paul Railroad was diked through the site early in the century a communityJM it was called Leader thenLsnappily built up around the depot Doig 167 three hotels several saloons a lumber yard stores a twostory bank a confectionary even a newspaper office When John Ringlings little railroad bumped down the valley from White Sulphur to link onto the Milwaukee and St Paul main line and the rumor followed that the headquarters of the great circus would be established there surely the centurys record M for village was optimistically renamed M Ringling But before the end of the 1920s hhe grandly adopted name was almost all that was left many of the businesses had burned in a single wild night of flame It was said and more or less believed that a Ku Klux Klan cross had blazed just before the lumber yard caught fire and spewed the embers that took half the town to the ground 4JA few years later another fire even less explainable than the first mopped up almost all of what was left By the time Grandma and I moved there Ringling stood as only a spattered circle of houses around several large weedy foundations The adult population was about 50 persons almost all of them undreamably old to me and the livelihoods were a saloon a gas station a post office Mike Ryans store the depot and exactly through the middle of town the railroad tracks which glinted and fled instantly in both directions Mornings an eastbound passenger train tornadoed through then came one tearing westward afternoons as people said it was the same except opposite My first days there I wondered Doig 168 about the travelers seen as tiny cutouts against the pullman windowsJwhat they were saying when they looked out at us and our patchy sprawled If they looked out These orangeandblack passenger trains whipped in and went off like kings and queens potent and unfussed on the dot But freight trains banged around at all hours and for a few weeks in autumn Ringling traffic as boSars of forth from the loading pens at the edge of town Otherwise the town did almost nothing but doze kept sleepily alive by the handful of people who lived there out of habit and the few ranchers who used it as their gasandmail point The single wan tendril to its past was Mike Ryans store which I lost not a moment before visiting Mike Ryan was a very ancient man by then nearblind looming in his goggling spectacles and flat cap amid a grayed avalanche of hardware harness stray dry goods and stale groceries such as the bakery goods his cats liked to sleep on The second words Mike spoke to you after a broguey Hello and learning what it was you wanted always were Now its here if I can just find it And it would be for Mike Ryans had been a store in its time a vast overstocked bin of merchandise behind its high and under its roof with the yellow airplane signals painted hugely on But now as if the years were Doig 169 caving in on it the enterprise was becoming more and more muddled dim musty At times Mike himself would dim away into some reverie and would no longer see a person come in the doIDr and you could stand for moments watched only by his brindle cats and hear him breathe an old mans heavy resigned breathing Just as Mike Ryans was the fading memory of a general store and Ringling itself the last scant bones of a town Grandmas house turned out to be the shell of a place to live in It counted up all too rapidly into a kitchen living room and bedroom each as narrow as a pullman car and about a third as long The rooms had stood empty for more than ten yearslempty of people that is for the flotsam M of Grandmas earlier family leaned and teetered everywhere Diving into the dusty boxes and dented metal suitcases I came up with a boomerang sent by the son who had moved to Australia after the war a lavendersenameled jewelry box which had been my lbums of strange people in stiff clothes 1The place was stacked with dead time and the first few days Grandma could not move in it without tears brimming her eyes When at last she could she called me into the bedroom and wordlessly began to dig down through the stacks and piles atop a low reddish wooden chest just larger than a seamans trunk As I watched she propped the lid looked down into the tumble of old clothes and ancient bedding inside and snuffled Doig 170 Then a quick honk into her handkerchief and she began talking in a tone angrier than I had yet heard from her This here was your mothers hope chest The kids dad made it back at Moss Agate when she first started going with Charlie With your dad I mean He worked on this at nights for the longest time See he didnt have anything to make it from but some pieces of flooring but he wanted her to have a hope chest of some kind He did a good job with it He could when he wanted to Its sat here all these years I want it to be yours now The back of my throat filled and tightened as she talked I gulped managed to say All right and walked carefully from the room so J Life wit p to I from it be full of squalls of emotion of that sort For one thing she had a temper fused at least as short as Dads But where he would explode into words she would go silent lips clamped If she could be persuaded to say anything the words were short and snapped displeasure corking each sentence and you discovered you were better off to let her be wordless4fI know now that such silences came out of years of having no other defense of being alone on a remote ranch nowhere to go no other person to unbend to when a stormy husband went into his own black moods But I did not understand it then and found myself suddenly in a household which could change as if a cloud had zoomed across the sun Doig 171 The quickest annoyance I could cause was to look at her when she had her false teeth out for brushing and after a time or two of blundering into that I would veer off or turn my back if I saw it in prospect There even was a way she could rile herself as I had guessed on the train trip to snorer and in the middle of A the night was apt to snort herself awake and mutter angrily about itqiBut otherJY of the unexpectednesses which kept tumbling out of her were entirely something even when there was nothing to be done sat at I the kitchen table and played game after game of solitaireZfj when the cards continued to turn up wrong for her she would cheat just once to try to get the game moving again which I thought was balanced good sense And whenever she won the identical proclamation I got that game boy What do you think of thatcpAlso she was perpetually ready to go into a version of my childhood I had never heard of before When she had visited my father and mother so often in the first three or four years of my life it had been she who spent many of the patient hours to teach me to read the words fastening in my mind as I sat in her lap and watched her finger move along with her reading And much else Oh how you used to coax me to sing hAHah SING gramma bl youd say So Id have to hold you in the rocker and sing by the hour Poor me v youd say when you didnt get your way and youd pooch out your lower lip so sad Lands you used to scare me half to death the way you ran down that Doig 172 hill at the Stewart Ranch There was a big tree way up on slope and youd take your dog up there and here the both of you would come straight down I used to hold my breath cAnd back beyond all that she had the news of how Id arrived into the world You were born in Dr McKays hospital in White Sulphur its that building just up the hill oh whats the name of that joint Hmpf The Stockman just up the hill from the Stockman When you were born you had two great big warts right here in front of your ear and your right foot splayed off like this and you had the reddest hair You were something grand to see all right Nor was that nearly all At times she talked a small private language which must have come from those two islanded times of childhood her own growing up on the Wisconsin farm and her childrens years at Moss Agate Words jigged and bellied and did strange turns then Ill have a sipe more of coffee but if I eat another bite Ill busticate Get the swatter and dead that fly for me pretty please Hmpf I been settin so long my oldbhinder is stiff Anything which lay lengthwise was longways to her the stanchions of a milking barn were stanchels the cows themselves were a word of my mothers as a child merseys Her sayings too took their own route of declaring That it was time to get a move on Well this isnt buying the baby a shirt nor paying for the one hes got on Or to take a doubtful chance Here goes nothin from nowhere Or when she did not understand something I read to her from one of Doig 173 my books Like the miser mans well too deep for me boy Or when she did understand I see said the blind man to his deaf wife Neighbors were rapidly tagged with whatever they deserved She goes around lookin like shes been drawed through a knothole backwards That pair is close as three in a bed with one kicked out That tribe must never heard that patch beside patch is neighborly but patch upon patch is beggarly Each time the prairie wind swirled up her dress there would be said Hmpf Balloon ascension At least one meal of the day she would pause between forkfuls and pronounce like a happy benediction I hear some folks say they get so tired of their own cooking By gee I never have And whenever something irked her which was sufficiently often she had her own style of notquite cussing Gee gosh god darn gosh blast it And always the stories such as the one of an early Moss Agate neighbor a homesteader who had a head huge and twisted as an ogres After a lifetime of despair over his own ugliness the man began rethinking it all and soon before he died proudly willed his skull to medical science As I shivered a bit at the tale Grandma chuckled and said in her declaring style Headless man into heaven think of that To my surprise dogs and cats fully counted into her conversations Dad likely had not glanced in a cats direction ears and he spoke to dogs only to send them ivestock A Doig 174 But Grandma loved them all especially all dogs There had been one or another of them generally named Shep in her households ever since a huge woolly sheepdog back on her parents Wisconsin farm and the last of thatname had moved to Ringling with us41A fine with a hint of collie about him Shep had gone old and as lazy as my mother would allow anything to be He panted as he walked and spent most of life stretched under the kitchen table where he filled all the space there was Several times a day Grandma would shift her feet as she sat at the table playing solitaire and there would be an explosion of pained howling and outraged sympathy Well you shouldnt be there right under my feet thats what you get Serves you right you arent hurt big baby Come here let me pet it Jlease thats all right M4S there youre all better now sign of good humor was to break into roughhouse play with Shep or any other available dog setting off wild barking and leaping which invariably ended with fresh bleeding scratches on her arms By then all the skin between wrist and elbow carried white nicks of scar as if she had been lightly scored with a scalpel time after time But that annoyed her less than the bathroom habits Shep and the others ungratefully put on display in front of her Their natural and leglifting sent her into prompt fury She Dont be so sappy Get away from there you darned Cats too aloof wayfarers that they were did not manage to live up to her standard of expectation Any that passed by she fed as if they were famished but Doig 175 naughty orphans scolding and huffing over them all the while she filled the dish with milk and bread What do you mean bumming around here Why dont you stay to home where youve got good grub I ought to let you go hungry sappy old thing Here eat The only creatures in her world which got no affection with their scoldings were magpies She hated their scavenging habits and when she saw one making its flash of glide in the air anywhere within range of her voice she cut loose GIT Git yourself out of here god darned old thing theres nothing gonna die here for you to peck on Git GIT Jr J ecN JiI ettied in if living amid such salvoes could be called settling in by somehow coaxing the tiny Ringling house tostretch and once more make way for people When the single closet was full we stashed boxes and suitcases under the bed and davenport as if ballasting the place All the time we lived there Grandma grumbled things in and out from under the bed vowing someday shed not have to do so The ironing board went in with a tangle of fishpoles behind a door my mound of books covered the hopechest at the foot of the one bedif bed for I learned at once that living with my grandmother always meant that she claimed the worst accommodations for herself and the dreariest chores This chivalry she must have formed in the Moss Agate years she found that she minded the drudgeries there less than did her edgy husband or my frail mother or her frisky sons and so took most of them upon herself Beyond that there simply Doig 176 was her assumption that if I was to be a special benefit she would happily pay any price in choresqDad had been thoroughly right about one high matter my grandmother did want me as a child to raise the way a retired clipper captain might have yearned to make one last voyage down the trade winds under clouds of sail Despite Dads wariness of it there had been little chance that she could have arrived in my life without his arranging it Now that he had done so here I was as the bonus child for her penchant about familyJby several years the oldest of her grandchildren and the shadowson of her lost daughter Everything in her said to treat me as a gift and in terms of this new Ringling household it came out as her granting me the bed and the bedroom while she slept on the davenport in the living room her climbing out first in the chilly mornings to light the kitchen stove with fuel oil and match her doing every other task the place needed until blessed common sense edged through and suggested that what might do me more good would be to have duties of my own How do you feel about that she offered cautiously r think it wouldnt hurt you none do you Unarguably it wouldnt and I began then to take my turn at keeping the woodbox piled with firewood and the ashes emptied from the bottom of the kitchen range But the main and everlasting chore was the water lucket because the house had no well and a neighborhood pump had gone rusty from years Doig 177 of disuse The rain barrel at a corner oftBeihouse did the job for laundering clothes and a washtub bath apiece for us once a week But every dipperful of the water for our daily use had to be pumped next it at seventy steps in one of my earliest trudgesat the house of Grandmas longtime friends Kate and Walter Badgett And by unexpected fortune that perpetual bucketing carried with it something new and rich for necessitys water was the least of what this ancient pair could add to our Ringling life There were enormities about the Badgetts which somehow seemed to bolster us simply by existing so near at hand These began with size and age and went on through manner Side by side the two weathered figures loomed like barn and silo Kate was pillowed in fat so wide that she seemed to wedge apart the arms of the huge easy chair where she spent her days Atop that crate of a body was an owlish face and a swift tongue that could operate Walter all day long and still have time to tell what the rest of Ringling was doing On her desk by the front window which looked across the tracks to the gas station and post Kate kept her pair of binoculars Who had come to town for how long and maybe even what they boughtlit all came up the magnifying tunnel of vision to Kate then went out with new life as if having added to itself while reechoing through that bulk of body Then in some midtsentence of hers Walter would appear from one or another of his chores in his pauseful way looming Doig 178 tall as a doorway and nearly as stillMa rangy silent sentinel with great hands hung on poles of arms His face was more an eagles than any other I have seen on a man the spare lines of brow and cheek and the chisel of nose somehow with the hint of a beak and beneath it all the mouth which turned down sharply at its corners not from mood but just the decades of pursing around a cusp of chewing tobacco Walters eyes were a pale flat shade of blue Once I heard someone tell of seeing him angry which I never had He was tending bar for the day at the saloon there in Ringling and one of Rankins cowboys came in with a load on He was helling around up and down the bar and Walter told him Better settle down a bit The Rankin man cussed him and said the hellre you old fellerll Walter came leanins across that bar those blue eyes snapping sparks said youd better settle down or Ill settle you The Rankin man never said another word Both corning onto eighty years old the Badgetts were in the kind of outliving contest which very old couples sometimes seem to have each aging only against the other instead of against time Naturally Kate was going to win and she did by nearly a decade But at this point they both seemed as little changing as glaciers and Walter in particular had slowed life to the exact amble he wanted Midmornings he would stroll to his woodpile halfway between his house and Doig 179 ours and begin chopping with giant strokes the axe easily high then down in a slow arc a whunk as the wood blasted apart and spun away into the dirt Walter would straighten loose a long splatter of tobacco juice study around town for anything to report to Kate reach with one hand to set another piece of wood on the chopping block then whunk that woodpile which would have kept half the county snug for a winter spent his mornings After he could be seen in his slow angular stroll headed for the q1 rO 9 post office to bring Kate the days letters and any capturable gossip Even his responses to her could come slow as a measuring now because he had a fitful mild deafness which gave him the excuse to answer an innocent uncomprehending Hnnh while he mulled the latest of her constant orders I rr10 Theirs was a household at once curt and Knock A on the door and Kates voice boomed a single word like an empresss COME I was puzzled that she had the habit of calling oth women only by their last names Grandma always LS i 111 lA a VAJj to her in it ovr the oned every thinkable ice out of I v Walter except for his habit of chewing tobacco for that he was permitted a coffee can behind the stove to spit in Yet when she talked to him for any reason besides an order the tongue that banged bluntly on every other life in town suddenly went soft and crooned of all words Hubby Walter had drifted north from Texas as a young cowboy and I would learn from men who had worked with him in the valley that he was a storied man with horse and rope The stories included the hint that he had departed Texas after a scrape against the law Even here Kate matched him out of her background wafted the whisper that in Prohibition times she had been one of the areas most reliable vendors of bootleg whiskey two serene old outlaws then gifted us with of accumulated For me parceled out for the Castles his high Grandma afterher long l e of listened to encouraging gosh Kate played canasta forth like bartering as scary tales of cowboying was I was riding up under the alters hand as big rubbing I just bones as if sharpening them here to those shanties at Pttt I was ridin a chestnut He had a coat just about like yotrhair there Doig 181 e ed down and I couldnt tell what color he was was stickin to us so The voice steady wind I ot us in Red didnt like that doorway and the wind whooping was better than Another pttt again was close midnight before it let the ranch I went in the bunkhouse ou been Walt Well I said the weather When Grandma mail bus to White Sulphur every so of ten to shop walk down to eat supper with Walter same fried mush with dark Walter first toasted shrapnel of crumbs last would sit back tall Well reckon we can make a steadiness a carol out of the valleys past and for all I knew out of the past of all the world Up the slope from our house the other regular chimes in our Ringling life spoke weightier accents graver outlooks Mr and Mrs Brekke both had been born in Norway and both come young to the new life Doigj182 in America they met and married found a small ranch beyond Ringling where they endured through to prosperity and now their family long grown the pair of them lived at the top of the tiny town like gentlefolk quite surprised at their own new position of courtliness Each early afternoon Mr Brekkes serious singsongJP HELlolwould sound on our porch and he would hand in the mail he had brought from the post office already backing away with a gentle smile from our thanks and invitations to come in for a moment Mrs Brekke did come at least once a day either to our house or to the Badgetts to hear the doings of the town with a steadily astonished Ohh myy Leaving she invariably turned and urged Why dont you come up sometimes for ice cream and cake The Brekkes owned the one house in all of Ringling that looked as if it truly had been built to live in rather than just to hold boards up off the ground A yard rulered neatly around it framing a few small tidy trees1the only ones in townkand a manywindowed sun porch which opened the entire front of the house The first owners were a husband and wife who had been the local schoolteachers a couple storied for their learning and their books and a decade or so of magazines came to the Brekkes with the house These I mined weekend after weekend carrying home an armload of old issues of National Geographic and Life and Colliers and Doig 183 Saturday Evening Post at a time reading them lying on my bed with the hot bedlamp at my ear Mr and Mrs Brekke admired education almost as if it were a magic potion When their own children were growing up and one or another would protest not knowing the answer to something Mary Brekke had a single iron reply Well you better learn Now they encouraged me into each new printed trove as soon as I had finished the last one Done with that batch Mr Brekke would M cry Come in for some more And Mrs Brekke would cry after Then sit a minute for some ice cream and cake cant you The Brekke households secon hand magazines and books became a second school for me more imagination lit from it than one I rode the bus to in White Sulphur Springs each weekday I read straight through whatever shone dark on the snowfield pages a visit to Scintillating Siam lapping on into the swashbuckling of Horatio Hornblower which likely took place with a Clarence Budington Kelland shootout in the Arizona Territory I read that is to say as an Eskimo who had never before seen a movie might watch the newsreel and then the cartoon and then the feature film without ever knowing to separate them in his mind simply letting himself be taken with the habited flow of flashing images It all began adding up in my head in deposits which astonished Grandma Her own information about the world was as spotty as mine was swirlish She had been born when a Doig184 man named Grover Cleveland was ihat she had no idea of this merely spoke her own unusual way of having been brought up She was perplexed that there had been two Presidents named Roosevelt Franklin Delano had served such a span in her adult life that she could easily believe he had been in the White House back at the turn century as well The labor leader John L Lewis and the boxing champion Joe Louis consistently mixed their names for her and surprised when she asked me if the Hemenway on the radio was the Hemingway whose books showed up now and then in my rummage from the Brekkes She seemed entirely pleased with my knack for knowledge and quickly learned to use it as a kind of utility asking me to spell out stubborn words when she wrote a letter to work out the balance in her checkbook to comparisonshop the Monkey Ward and Sears Roebuck mailorder catalogues for our items of clothing But lore ran both ways between us and generally hers was more useful than mine having come straight out of life instead of from printed pages She recalled for me a pastime that her sons once tried setting up a lemonade stand and taking turns to shout across town the advertising she taught them Lemonade lemonade Stirred by an old maid With a spade I thought it over but at last decided the business wasnt worth reviving Ringlings population had plummeted so far that the only buying traffic I could foresee was Walter Doig 185 Badgett and Mr Brekke But another idea Grandma recalled had the right feel The same enterprising sons had sent away for any free mailings they came across in magazines and since Ringling had no street names conjured for themselves whatever elaborate addresses they could think of I got out B and envelopes and set to work on the most Quickly offers for stamp collecting kits or pleas for me to get rich selling salve were pouring into the post office in care of I Clark Doig 776 Sagebrush Acres or 14 Jackrabbit Boulevard or 801 Gopher Gulch or whatever other elegancy Id been abie to dream up Grandma much admired my gaudy mail I much admired her for the lode of boyraising behind it That exact lode I began to find came ready more and more as adolescence perked in me Together she and I pondered the pale frizz of hair taking over my upper lip At the precise age when other boys were praying for some hint of whiskers I badly wanted to be rid of that downy white shadow Grandma of course had been through thistfiand apparently everything elseJbefore She came up with a salve called a depilatory 1 which erased the fuzz right enough and felt as if my lip were being scorched away with itClrmpressed with her results I asked if she knew anything to be done about my hair which had a stubborn tendency to divide itself floppily on the exact top of my head as if I had been bashed there with a cleaver At once she dug out one of her discarded nylon stockings and Doig 186 snipped and sewed it into a snug skullcap Well damp your hair down before you go to bed and you sleep with this over it and well see how that does How it did was that within weeks her remedial yarmulka tamed the thatch into the pompadour I had worn out a lifetime of combs trying to achieve She was as handy with my other disquiets such as the passion for baseball which had been brewing in me The onset of this likely had come from Dad who in his youth had played catcher for the Sixteen community team Did I tell ye the time we had a big Fourth of July game goin while Jack Dempsey was fishtin Gibbons up in Shelby Nineteen that would have been We were havin a helluva game down there by Sixteen Creek but somebodyd run down from the telegraph office at the end of every round and tell us what was happenin with the fight so it took us half the afternoon to play an innins or two Then at World Series timeAin 1946 Dad had got tired of chums mutter about the invincibility of th on Red A Sox team and uncharacteristically began betting them that it wasnt so He quickly they added up to a couple Cardinals won for him Whether it was that windfall or some other it may simply have been that Ringling was a perfect place to tinker at imagination because so little else about the town Doig 187 was in working order any moreLr had begun to daydream of myself as a shortstop or a pitcher or maybe both strolling across the infield to the mound every fourth day or so to fire fastballs Now all of a sudden I had a teammate Grandma tirelessly would toss a rubber ball for me to bat back and forth across Ringlings emptinesses Our audience was Walter Badgett launching his contemplative splatters of tobacco juice as he glanced over from his woodchopping Once in awhile the ball would bounce toward Walter and he would pick it up and fling it back in a sweeping stiffarmed motion like a weathered old which still could crank up Grandma and I went on with this even if it rained playing catch inside treihouse by bouncing the pall usthe scant twenty feet from lYtl fb lay1 room the kitchen my Bedroom It comes as a constant surprise to me to realize that even here where she first came into my life my grandmother already was nearly sixty years old Everything I can remember of this time has the tint of her ageless energy entertainment failing she was even willing to wrestle and we would tussle stiffcarmed against one another until we both giggled to a halt and she panted herself down into a chair saying Whoof Nosir youre just too tough for your old gramma I cant keep up with a wildcat like you And in half a minute she would be up and in the kitchen into the making of the next batch of bread or cinnamon rolls or butter Doig 188 cookies But one matter of that growing time of mine not even her savvy and energy had come up against before A bulge the size of a robins egg appeared on my right leg just below the kneecap It was tender as a burn and after some weeks anything I at last tears whenever the knee came against showed her She scowled I of wincing almost to Hmpf Well better get that looked at when yourdad comes The doctor in Livingston sat me on the end of a metal table pressed the bump and watched me lift in pain Xrays showed what he already knew the knob of the long bone in my leg had cracked away a hairline crevice now daggering through The danger was he told us that this bone cap could be lifted further away by the pull of the large muscle across the kneecap1like the tugging power of a rope working M across a pulley To prevent that I would have to keep the leg straight have to bandage the knee constantly keep pressure wrapped down onto the bone knob so that it would grow back into place If I did not there was a chance the leg would wither Medical science has changed its mind about that and considers now that my fiery kneelthe textbook term for the ailment is Shlotters Diseasewas not permanently afflicting and in time would have calcified its own fracture line But I walked from the doctors office then with only the understanding Doig189 that I must drag my right leg stiff for a few years if I were not to drag it all my life I was miffed that Grandma could be so matteroff act about all this Wrap it snuglike and do what the doctor said M and youll get like new kept me at the chores we had agreed on the water bucket sloshing maliciously now as I swung my leg along The first several times I made a stoic show of circling the yards of elastic bandage around my knee and into a tight crisscross over the bone knob And then it became simply a groove of habit and I became interested in how much I would ask of the mummied leg I still could run if in an odd stilty style still could bat the ball thrown by Grandma could wrestle her could get on almost as before My laming it turned out had happened in the best possible companythat which shrugged it off and silently told me I M had better do the same Grandma and I went into our first winter together A small window faced straight west just above the head of my bed Mornings as the first sounds of day scuffed outside I had been able to sleepily lift myself on an elbow and see which of the towns cows or horses or sheep were munching past Now this window also told the weather even without my looking all the way out mewls of wind came sneaking under the sash and on genuine blizzard mornings the sill would have its own miniature snowscape tiny sifts white as spilled sugar4we learned at once that on blowy days our house leaked Doig 190 wind everywhere like a weary little scow jetting water into itself the instant it touched the surface of the sea Hardly knowing where to plug first we would stuff a rag rug along the crack under the front door pull the blinds down over the whistling windows desperately fire up both the big square range in the kitchen and the little round stove in the living room and hope for the storm to ease away promptly Shivery and caging as such blizzard weather was it had to be admitted that Ringling looked much its best in a storm The bald gaps between houses lost their starkness with windrows of snow gracefully coned between them The very whiteness of a snowstorm came as a relief a bright sudden paint over the worn town Somehow too space danced itself along the wind into new distances if we could not see the depot a hundred fifty yards down the slope the storm counted as a genuine shrouding blizzard and we slogged around telling one another what a very devil of a bluster this was Mr Brekke looked like a general in winter camouflage when he handed our mail through the doorway now Kates binoculars could not cut the feathery swirl and find the news for the usual couriers gait of her tongue so Grandma went over to play canasta with her by the hour to compensate Walters woodpile heaped under the whiteness like a buried haystack The trip to the Badgetts for water became a feat of walking with chin tucked into your coat and the filled water bucket Doig 191 tugging you as you broke through the drifts Another trip its hazards as well Grandma Fn I joked the visit to old Mother Jonesabout how far out out into the prairie since the blizzard whirled in The only thing in the neighborhood which still seemed to be in place was Shep and he was more firmly planted than ever Throughout he could not be budged from under the kitchen table and so was stepped on by Grandma ten times a day instead of his usual half dozen his injured howls a matecry out into the keening of the blizzard Then when the snowfall and wind at last stopped the worlds one noise would be the of boots on snow In the fresh straight up from chimneys until it appeared as if the fat gray ribbons were dangling all the towns houses down into a bowl of snow The comfortable cushioned silence would last until the first pickup truck began the fast ratatatat of its chained tires In this weather as all other once a week Dad would appear out of the night The job he had taken after his operation was with a sheep rancher named McGrath at the Camas ranch fifty miles from us on the far side of White Sulphur Springs Dad intended to bide through there until he would have the contract to harvest the ranchs big hay crop But he had come up with an idea further The Camas might be a place for Grandma and me as well Doig192 I would wake at once those nights he arrived and come intent as a hiding fox The open doorways leading from the kitchen to the living room and on into my bedroom were aligned and a panel of light came thrusting through them all onto the foot of my square flame from the charged talk which was beginnin across the kitchen ritual I quickly knew by heart Dad would ask if there might be a can of beer in the house just anithing for a sip This was high risk a step out onto the nearest swaying edge of Grandmas temper but he always did it as if answering some challenge If Grandma pulled her mouth tight and her long dipping came out he was in fast trouble no matter that he had fought blizzard roads across the night to spend time with her But if not if the moment came mellow enough in her she would get out the beer for him and he would persuade her to take a tiny glass of it herself the only alcohol she would touch Letting my breath ease I would curl closer toward the portal of light to hear what would come along it next That old heifer of a cook bX God I cant see McGrath keeps her on The meal she put on the table this noon I wouldnt make this dog here eat Liver fried until you could use it for shoeleather and a little f boiled spuds and stand for it much more thexll be for their checks And Mrs McGrath just sits there and her with it Doig 193 McGrath is no better he ought to know that a crew is only as content as its cooking Funny damn way to run a ranch or Ill put in with you The notion sheened a bit more each time out of his talk If the cook at the Camas were to be let go if the job could be Grandmas Theres a helluva big house there plenty of room in the upstairs where I am for the three of us Ivan would have to stay some place in White Sulphur for school a bit of the year but weekends and the summer wed be all together A waiting A beer bottle is set on the table a small glass follows This oh so carefully What of the idea Lady And Grandma who has been offering only hmpfs until now I dont just know Waiting I suppose it would be good there Waiting For darn sure we could use the wages and Im plumb able to work Invisible in my is the mystery of this M time that no one ever caught on that I was a light sleeper and would hear anything said at any hour in that slim houseJ11 I would listen to Dad once more ease his night of trying to talk the future around to his own route Well we 11j ust have to watch our chance Ill put it to McGrath in a minute if that cook is let go And you can see then what you think The echo from Grandma Yes we can see then His good night hers Then my fathers body at bed edge Ivan Ivan Doig 19L Move across a bit son Im home I sigh pretended sleep up at him and heavily shift across the bed away from the eyelet of light Winter at last brawled itself out and spring basted Ringling in mud for some weeks Near the start of summer Dad brought about his notion Grandma was offered the job as cook at the Camas ranch Golly gee I dont suppose it ought to be turned down only I hate to break up housekeeping here again and break it up we instantly did closing the house in Ringling more boxes than ever stacked into it saying our goodbyes and thanks to Kate and Walter and the Brekkes driving with Dad in the pickup to the place where the three of us could be together or at least less separate The ranch buildings stood out from behind the lofty line of cottonwoods on the west bank of Camas Creek just at the base of the grassed ridges stairstepping up into the Big Belts Nothing of the ranch seemed ever to have been thought into any order the bunkhouse happening first road its paint long vanished into a gray flecking scurf next to it a small log shed with the wood dark and timestained and the chinking bright between the stacked roundnesses Then squatted a blacksmith shop a lower log shed which seemed to have pilfered out at nights and brought home countless scraps of iron trinkets of harness tosses of wire to make a great rusty nest around itself Finally began an arc of an acre or two of battered machinery auto carcasses and skewed reaper reels Doig 195 and generations of hay rakes and mowing machines Out of the clutter looming up from the shaley roadway and backdropped by a yellow shale hillside stood a high square grayish house as if it were a giant crate absent indedly put down there So overbig was this building that it could only be occupied like a hotel rather than lived in The McGraths even though one reach of room along almost the entire back of tlEhouse held only the long table where everyone on the ranch ate had barely managed to habitate the first floor and a central stairwell remorselessly marched on to another warren of rooms upstairs Dad and I shared a corner bedroom up there Grandma was given one across tbestairwell and the rest of the rooms either yawned emptyorwere crammed with stray boxes The Camas house was highceilinged and Even on summer nights the wind off the Big Belts slapped our corner room It was chilly quarters in more ways than that only a few clothes hung starkly in the closet our underwear and socks in a dresser drawer all else cached in the house at Ringling We felt encamped rather than settledLoad was still sizing up McGrath deciding how far to cast us in with M and the flow of life through the house did nothing to ease that feeling Daylong there surged a restless tribal coming and going the crew men trooping in for breakfast the chore boy hauling in pails of milk and buckets of eggs me wandering in and out eleven dozen times a morning McGrath and Dad coming in for a cup of coffee the men trooping in for lunch Grandma Doig 196 back and forth to the garden McGrath arriving with a hungover sheepherder he was delivering off to a sheep camp me wandering some more Mrs McGrath off to give McGrath some message she had forgotten at lunch the choreboy bucketing in more milk more eggs the men trooping in for supper People coming and going around here like chickens with their heads chopped off Grandma sometimes muttered even as she herself apron flapping hustled down the storebin stairs for the twentieth time A different disorder went on during meals when a dozen or twenty of us it was one of Grandmas instant and justified M grumbles that she never knew what the total was going to beA1might be lined along the span of oilclothed table McGrath had a small stinging sense of humor like a popper on the end of his whiplike temper His one favorite story guffawed mealtime after mealtime was of the fellow he had seen fork in a mouthful of overhot potatoes spit them into his hand and hurl them back to his plate with the shriek Now blaze damn you blaze His other notion of fun was to single out one of the crew and fire questions about the days work delaying the man in his eating until everyone else had finished Then McGrath would rear out of his chair and bray Well lets go back to work Andy from the looks of your plate you must notve been hungry Somehow McGraths swagger had attracted a demure wife half his size and a fraction his conceit They whiffed past each other in life McGrath in his steady gale of bluster and Doig 197 Mrs McGrath eddying and zephyrlike Her one mistake which she made every week or so was to try to edify the table talk above sheep ailments and butts of hay Once she announced out of nowhere that she had just read in a magazine that every one of the sons of Franklin Delano Roosevelt was of strapping build over six feet McGrath looked at her not unkindly but puzzled and said What in the name of Bejesus H Christ does that have to do with anything What anything had to do with anything on theCamas often was not clear beginning with McGrath himself With his cask of chest the even grander gut beneath and a great boxy head jowled like a bulldogs he always looked roundly out of place on foot Saddle years had bowed his legs wide and he toed along in cowboy boots as if hating each touch of the ground But on horseback the legs pegged down into the stirrups as if into a socket his swell of chest looked right the ugly head somehow went against the sky like the profile of a Comanche could flip a lasso onto anything his horse could catch up with and whooped his own cheers when he did Within weeks after the three of us at last were living at the Camas one of McGraths new sheepherders who hadnt sufficiently dried from a spell of boozing went out of his head and his clothes and ran off naked into the hills McGrath grabbed a lariat from his pickup heaved onto the herders surprised nag and joggled away in pursuit Dabbed it on Doig 198 first throw too he blared to us at trenext mealtime Had him snubbed down for the doc in no timelwhy this bredinthbone ropehand had turned to sheep ranching no one knewjM although some made the guess that having been discovered searing his own brand on another partys cattle had something to do with it On whatever wind of chance McGrath had landed at the Camas and leased six thousand fat ewes to put on its grass Hes quite the McGrath Grandma said soon after we arrived and did not mean it in admiration From Dads stories it came as no surprise to see that McGrath ran the ranch as if showing the world a trick from under his hat Decisions were all jangle and swashJc morning everyone might be flung into fence mending as if every post on the ranch were going to crash over lunch McGrath would have the entire crew ricocheting to some forgotten corner of the range to shove sheep onto fresh pasture It was noticeable that McGrath had the clever bullys instinct about who to leave out of his loosely flung orders Instead of his bluster Dad and Grandma were favored with controlled grumbles of suggestion Grandma of course met McGrath in kind but Dad seemed more bemused Ye can tell this spread from half across the valley he declared as he watched the agitation Its the one with dust clouds going every direction at once McGrath had quirks further He let what looked like a rogues gallery of the dog world roam the ranchhalf a dozen Doig199 mutts and slinkers whose one common characteristic was that they were almost useless around sheep Shep had not survived his winter the life gone from him one night as he lay in his peace beneath the kitchen table in Ringling even admitted that it was fortjnate he was not on hand to contend with this bullying packftMcGraths philosophy about his crew seemed the same as his notion about dogs He hired some of the most hopeless of men on the calculation that he could get by with paltry wages and yet harry them into doing one day arrived from town with anotherherder who was lurching out of several weeks of cheap wine and when he had sobered enough to wobble to the supper table it began to become clear that our newcomer had barely enough English to pronounce that he was straight from Finland All else came out in some beyondHelsinki gabble as if he were chewing glass Cant savvy what the hell his name is McGrath mused between the splutters Well just call him Finnigan Two of the crew had been with McGrath for years beating along behind him through southern Montana from one leased ranch to the next They had done so for so long that their names were hardly spoken separate on the Camas simply splined into MickeyandRudy as if they were twins They were anything but Doig 200 4 Mickey had a froggy face and build one cheek forever wadded with tobacco and lifting his vast mouth into a disgusted smirk his wide low shoulders always halfhunched as if to ward off the next bluster from McGrath No one could quite decipher why Mickey stayed on and on with McGrath but it must have fed a habit of disgracing himself By every instinct in him Mickey was a bunkhouse lawyer grouser something just short of a saboteur He could slouch through his work for McGrath as much of it as he did in a slow huff and speechify inside himself about the misery of it all You could see his lips moving as he practiced his outrage McGrath for his part cussed Mickey elaborately at least once a week with nips in between and put him on the dreariest jobs that came up Hornlocked together they showed never a sign of value for one another and every sign of going on with their blood feud until apoplexy truced it for one or the other of them But Rudy the other longtime hand would listen sharply to each of McGraths orders say in great agreement Right ou are with perfect deftness go off and do whatever task on the ranch he thought needed doing As he marched off in his own directions often with an irrigating shovel rifled on his shoulder Rudy looked like a frontier trooper strayed from a Remington sketch rodstraight backbone all his striding motion from the waist down noble white hair Doig 201 and a trimmed white mustache Also strange skills kept appearing from him He could play the violin and carve surprises from wood and had built a tiny model cannon which could blast a ball bearing through a oneinch board But the great startlement of this paradeground knight was his eternal spitting of snuff juice It squirted from him in abrupt brown blurts punctuating his sentences announcing a thought to come Rudy was the one man on the ranch never beset by mosquitoes and always claimed it was the snoose juice percolating through his bloodstream which kept them off When Dad hired on at the Camas it had been with the contract that when summer came he would thread through the disorder of the place and get the ranchs rich hay crop 1 gflv together through b harvested Somehow a crew had to be held the months of mowing and raking and bucking and stacking of butts of hay some 1400 tons of it when at last all the fields had been sickled and combed cleanand Dads reputation in the valley said he was a man to do it The first move he made was to turn down McGraths offer to include in the haying crew Ill have my own men and Ill particularly not have that pair He next left word with the bartenders at the Stockman and the Pioneer Out of their Saturday night throngs they sized men for him he winnowed the candidates and came back to the Doig 202 Camas one June evening with a complete haying crew of nine men By summers end nearly of delayed hay harvest behind had A tricky rain the same nine in the crew man after man among them asking to come back for the season again next year It was a matchless job of foremanning even for Dad who perhaps had needed to prove skill to himself again after his desperate time of sickness Whatever accounted for the silken summer of haying McGrath put it against his own slapbang style of crew being hired and more promptly fired and made Dad an offer to stay on at the Camas asLwhat Not foreman exactly because McGrath wanted M to be able to catapult MickeyandRudy and a few other hands around the ranch as he pleased Not entirely the sheep boss either although taking on a share of the camptending would be part of the job Dad was to be oh hell just generally in charge Charlie you know whats to be done on this spread The lambing shed and the haying season would be his to oversee the hay on beyond I a valuable contract of dollarsperton have direction of any of the crew not being reined around at the moment by McGrath himself The fuzzed line of typical of McGrathJM was a bothering notion but the offered wage was good particularly with the haying contract addedYalso j would be kept on as cook Well its something to Grandma try Dad Doig 203 offered and Grandma agreed With what was beginning to seem our tendency for somewhat askew arrangements we stayed on in the upstairs of the big house at the Camas In these earliest months at the ranch my grandmother and my father gingerly began to put together something like a family life for us The two of them being who they were that life of course came at the elbow of hard work and had to pant as best it could to keep up The one time of truce I could always count on was summer dusk After her dawnto supper day of cooking and house chores and his aslong day of haying and handling the crew Grandma would go with Dad to the hayfield and help him repair machinery for the M shave a drawknife along fresh pine poles to make teeth for the huckrake plop beside the stacker arm to grip a wrench onto a bolthead for him anything that needed doing on the downed equipment all of it done with a certain declared calm between them Yet those level evenings hardly ever held the pleasure for me they ought to have because Dads style of mechanicking meanwhile would have started me gritting my teeth He saw me fair is fair as his logical fetcher of tools during that repair work my ailing knee excused me from all other work during the haying What he did not see was that his notion of fetching had exactly the jittery rhythm or lack of it which I rapidly was learning to dislike about ranch work If I was sent to the pickup to dig out a boxhead Doig204 wrench for him the next moment I would be sent again to pick up the chisel which lay beside the wrench Nor was there any outguessing some further gizmo to send me trudging again or worse dogtrotting all the way to the blacksmith shop Six evenings might pass then with the pair of them gentled and me muttering behind my teeth and on the seventh the regular trip to White Sulphur Springs for groceries and into real trouble This as acute as if it is happening again now this father of mine has parked the pickup in front of the grocery store and says oh so much too offhandedly Well ye dont need me to get the groceries do ye Ill step over to the Stockman for a minute At best this grandmother of mine pushes out a level Well all right then as if being reasonable might justfetch him back that much sooner At worst comes the flat snapped I suppose which in truth means Yes and youre9oing to overstay and Im going to take you to war about it All during the grocery shopping with Grandma I my breath wondering if he will be back at the pickup by the time we get there Every once in awhile surprise to us all he is there and the mood leaps up the drive back to the Camas is full of chatter Most often he is missing I look desperately toward the Stockman hoping I can declare in triumph Here he comes now That hope snuffed I go on Doig 205 next one as we climb into the pickup maybe he will arrive before Grandma begins to mutterno too late Darn his hide anyway she steams why doesnt he come By every evidence in my memory and in the words of everyone I have found who knew him well my father cannot be called an unfeeling man He tended opposite fretful about a calamity on anyone he knew trailing generosities I still happen onto Knowed your daddy when I landed into this countr at shearing time at the Dogie He staked me for my bedroll I was so dead busted Didnt have to do it neither but he done er But with those waitings he inflicted a pain as sharp on my grandmothers mind as any that can be conjured She had had one relentless stint of waiting around in life for the saloons to let a man go and she seethed at the idea of another even if it amounted only to minutes of casual beer To Dad that is exactly what it did amount to The saloons and the men ranged on their barstools had been a heartbeat of him and of the valley all his grown life A beer or two was simply a chaser for the mellow conversation My own feelings were hopelessly mixed tiered I wanted Grandma not to be angry even as I was more than at Dad myself I thought up excuses for him Why shouldnt he have a breather to himself see his friends The world isnt gonna end over a few minutes of that I switched at once to Doig 206 the argument on our side The hell why do we have to stew in this pickup while he guzzles beer in there It was frazzling a crisscross of tensions cutting tight inside me And everything would become worse I knew if Grandma gave her final fidget and sent me to get him Gee gods see what hes doing in there If he wasnt ready pronto to leave the saloon then I had the predicament of trudging back to try to tell her soJAh he says hell be along in just a minute or of hanging M restlessly at his side until the spirit moved him both of us now rooted in the Stockman while she simmered across the street When he finally cameJall of this might have crackled M for only twenty minutes or generally would try an offhand Ready to go She would give it back to himLwe been Eeady for agesand the silent battle would begin Halfway t to the ranch one or the other might try to break it But most often a trip which started in ice ended the same and I would look aside out the window touching cold on my shoulder wordlessly crying a kind of prayer that the mood would get no worse damning in my head the one or the other of these chilly warriors Or more often the both Beneath it all was a hard unsaid truth we all knew The three of us by then had been together long enough and closely enough that if my father and my grandmother ways I now could have the choosing of A parted live Doig 207 withJand I would choose at once to go with Dad again I bring me up more steadily and standardly than he could in countless ways w ould make more sacrifices in her life for the sake of mine In justice to us all three of was the one to raise me less hazardously if choice ought to be made But I would never choose so By then I had been shaped on the opposite side of the family from her the side which indeed cared less for family than for friends and the valleys flow of life and so suggested that if my ranchman father could not manage to be enough family for me at least he was going to be a friend such as none other in the world The side too which always had half a off for opportunity rabher than settle in for n outlook and manner I suppose in inner M murmurations which I could not hear until much had become more thoroughly Charlie Doigs son than I could ever become Bessie Ringers grandson It lay as a hammer of fact amid us that she knew all this and that a woman who long since had determined she was through putting up with bad bargains in life and longer since had earned that right she could only accept these terms If that is she stayed on with Dad and me at all now that his health had mended once more It apparently became a guessing game in the valley whether she would A town Doig 208 voice has reported There was some that said they didnt see how she could take over the daughters husband and the child too But I said there was love there that was the way of it It wasnt quite the way of it for there still was all too little sign of loveLor affection or admiration or M much of any other warmthshown between my father and my M grandmother They were after all an alliance corded together only by the bloodline which knotted in me and perhaps the best that could have been expected of them was the wary civility of allies Some of the time as in the aftermath of those trips to town it took their most dogged efforts to muster that q rJ Yet the months added up and the three of us remained Ei under the same roof Rather Dad and Grandma remained under it and I edged under on weekends for when the school year began again I once more had to board out in White Sulphur If it had occurred to me over the next span of time I had all the grounds to demand of Dad just how this together family of ours was making my life any less unsettled In the several years between my mothers death and Grandmas arrival I had followed Dad through seven or eight places to live In the year and a half after Grandma and I left Ringling I r icocheted among half a dozen Two of Grandmas sons and their families lived in White Sulphur and whenever possible I boarded now with one or the other of them But the sons Doig209 themselves were in a period of changing jobs and homes and in fast sequence here when I was twelve and thirteen years old I hopscotched after them through households as various as they were numerous One of the places was a tiny house which had its toilet in the cellar reached by way of a trapdoor in the middle of the kitchen floor Another was a looming old box which had seen its last paint a generation before There even was a stint apparently in some moment when everyone else was between households back once more with Nellie and his wife who didnt have the advantage of being relatives but at least stayed put The pattern to all this was jagged but constant I would sleep on a couch in the living room of the moment spend my day at school roam town afterward as much as I wanted come back to whichever house it happened to beI once had a memory slip and returned to the one with the cellar toilet instead of the looming one across town lose myself in a book or magazine until bedtime dig the next mornings change of clothes from my suitcase behind the couch and settle in for the night again I found that everyone treated me fondly if a bit absen indedlyJas I had noticed at Jordans during Dad and Ruths winter of reconciliation the boarding child is something like a stranded visitor that people get accustomed to halfseeing at the edges of their visionLand no one least of all me seemed to think there was much unusual about Doig 210 my alighting here and there casually as a roosting pullet Yet perhaps the unsettledness had more effect than I realized for on weekends and in the summer I found myself islands of calm at the Camas ranch even amid the eddying energies of McGrath and his crew It helped that this house too held shelves of books as the Brekkes had Mrs McGrath had learned that burrowing off somewhere to read could keep her aside from her husbands swooshes through the place But when I borrowed from the shelves now I found scenes never dreamed of in the Brekke books They killed him in Spangle Valley They waited hidden among the rocks of Buffaloback Mountain and when he rode below they shot him out of the saddle She was right down there at my feet her eyes shining her breasts trembling drawn up in tight points and pointing up at me She was down there and the breath was in the back of my throat When I had enough of printed roarings for the moment the ranch could give me a silent place as well For by greatest luck a gray ship highhulled and pinging with emptiness rode at the far end of the ranch buildings A ship at least to my imaginings In the years when the machine chomped broadly through grainfields it was called a combine Now this dreadnought stood in its tons of dulling metal and clusters of idle gearwheels for me to climb into all through on careful hands and with my bandaged knee tensed Doig 211 straight behind me over the floorful of threshing blades past gearings fat with ancient grease which when I touched through its dried crust still came away slick in my hand through pencilthin rods of sunlight which drilled in around the gear housings and shaft ports at last to the dark maw which fell away in shelves of teeth and gratings to the nose of the machine The toes of my shoes clouted on sheet metal as I dodged under sets of spiky metal fingers and over driveshafts When I stopped the only sound was the ringing echo of my own listening It was as if the old combine the noisiest machine on earth in full shuddering gulp across a wheatfield had gone quieter than anything else when it at last quit work Even the days heat changed within its metal tunnels flattened and spread into a cooking sensation which came from everywhere at once I made a game of seeing how hot I could stand it in the dim shaft When the searing metal was too much for me I would climb up and out through a deft sliding panel in the machines top and into the sheet A which hung high over the side This was the lookout spot with baffling slippery angles which made me lodge my body across them and feel the tautness of watching eyeing the ranch cfj My mood there was to see everything as the edges of as if time were waiting in coiled shimmers behind the outline of whatever my watching picked out The gasoline tank for the ranch machinery with its round red face of metal which Doig 212 rang a deep blung when I hit a ball against it that would be the vast green left field fence of Fenway Park if I grew up to be a baseball player The meadows of wild hay splotched richly along Camas Creek and the climbing slopes of grass if I became a ranchman as Dad was there would be such land mile upon mile Grandma on the way in from the garden with her apron held full of vegetables she would magically become less sharpedged and a Lady as steady in temper as in her fondnesses Dad arrived from the hayfield in the pickup and then into his hurrying stride to find some repairing piece of metal from the rusty muss around the blacksmith shop the future magic would settle him into his best work turn him from any provoking of Grandma The clasped knee which began to twinge under me now it would heal at once and as quickly bear me out of growing up into these glimpsed tomorrows What I gained from the machines silences Dad perhaps had found in the busyness of the ranchs chief chorelthe M raising of sheep The Camas arili its seasons were occupied by the gray thousands of them as if they were some daft breed of dwarves helpless and demanding their long clown faces staring out in sad alarm from ruffs of wool The bands summered in the mountains plump targets for coyotes and bears and snagging branches spent autumn in mown hayfields where they could do their best to topple into irrigation ditches or Camas Creek itself wintered near the ranch buildings where in the nightly Doig 213 shed or corral they could try to huddle themselves into injury or suffocation But it was the first fade of winter the six thousand ewes drew the entire attention of Dad and everyone else on the ranch springtime and lambing time Lambing at the Camas stretched as one long steady emergency like a war alert which never quite ignites into battle keeps on demanding scurry and more scurry No ritual more frantic exists anywhere in the rearing of animals and McGrath hounded everyone around in their jobs to make it all the more skittish The season would begin reasonably enough in middle March a lamb or two tiny yellow sprawls of life would appear suddenly amid the several thousand ewes Dad as what was called day man would have had a helper or two readying the long low lambing shed on a knoll above Camas Creek Inside it now stretched rows of boarded pens about four feet square just large enough to hold a ewe and her lamb Since the pens were so like small crossbarred jail cells they wer e called jugs and once in the jug the first few lambs and their mothers were coddled and fussed over like the original customers of a seaside inn But one day soon half a lambs are born and the next day forty then a hundred one lamb or another starting its slow glistening dive from the womb into life wherever you looked now Then a sledge with half a dozen of the jug pens atop it and pulled by a team of horses would begin to Doig 214 the gutwagon named for the placenta and accompanying muss from the newlydelivered ewes Because Mickey was the worst choice for it and McGrath wanted to miss no chance to harass him toward betterment he was made the gutwagon driver Like a duke dropped barefoot into a manure pile Mickey would mince up to a fresh lamb snatch it up and try halfheartedly to persuade the mother into one of the gutwagon jugs When she wouldnt be lured he would have to grab her by the wool and wrestle her in or worse try to snare her by the hind leg with a sheephook and snake her in backwards Mickeys dour mauling was only the ewes first welcome to maternity As the gutwagon was unloaded Dad or 9ne of his helpers would tip each ewe onto her rump and hold her there while her teats were worked to be sure that milk would flow for the lamb Then she was strongarmed into one of the jugs and her lamb put in after4JSheep being sheep not all ewes had the idea that they were supposed to be ready to mother their lambs More than a few saw it all as a bad joke sniffing the tiny animal as if he were something sour and then often as not would butt him flat in the straw and begin walking on him Damn ye Dad would erupt what the hell xedoin to him Hes yours old sister just get used to the idea Ivan get in here and hold this goddamn pelter while I suckle the lamb With the lamb bulging with milk and the ewe more or less bullied toward motherhood Dad would send me for his paint Doig 215 tray Then ewe and lamb were each stamped in blotty digits about three inches high with a number which belonged to each other It also gave them a showed that they kind selfhood like hospital patients known by the traceries of their charts That 256 lamb has the drizzles That ornery damned 890 ewe still wont take her lamb The 722 lamb is a goner Im gonna have to jacket a fresh one onto that ewe Jacketing was a I watched with wonder each time and I have discovered that my father was admired among sheepmen up and down the valley for his skill at it He was just pretty catty at that the way he could get that ewe to take on a new lamb every time Put simply jacketing was a ruse played on a ewe whose lamb had died A substitute and into the tiny pelt carefully snip four small leg holes and a head hole Thenthe standin lamb would have the skin fitted onto it like a snug jacket on a poodle11The next step of disguise was to cut out the dead lambs liver and smear it several times across the jacket of pelt In its borrowed and bedaubed skin the new lamb then was presented to the ewe She would sniff the baby impostor endlessly distrustful but pulled by the of her own When in a few days her dim sheeps mind to accept the lamb Dad mn111i the jacket and reci victory Mother him like

sheepherders strode or rode its slopes of pasture and they Doig 219 added up to something like a race of hermit gypsies Countless of them went through life trapped in their homeland language it was a historic joke that the eastern end of the county originally had been populated entirely by Norwegian herders who knew but two words of English Martin Grande the name of their employer Fairly or not the numbers of Romanians who arrived as herders had a particular reputation for shunning any language but their own Their chosen air of simply no savvy There exists the exasperated report of an early forest ranger who came upon a Romanian herder placidly spreading his sheep across an allotment of cattle range All I could get out of him was No savvyYuntil I applied a shotloaded quirt it was surprising how quickly the incident got to all the Romanians in that district McGrath had neither Norwegians nor Romanians on his slopes just then but he did have the baffling While McGrath blared and chortled Finnigan could only shake his head slowly as an ox and clack some gibberty mystery back to him Karl the Swede was another uncertain talker his shy throaty sentences so low they seemed to come out of his shirt collar instead of his mouth Other herders had the language but not the inclination to do much with it One I remember hated even to say Hello when we arrived at his camp he would stand half sideways with his eyes darting to the timber until gradually he would face aroundand at last begin to make Doig 220 sentences All in all stepping out of the pickup at a herders camp had some of the touchiness of coming ashore on a selfexiles island I can think of only one of McGraths herders who seemed entirely to thrive on the lonesome life Louie a tall soldierly man with a German accent He owned a pair of tiny deft binoculars which snapped open like a case for eyeglasses and spent his time peering for wildlife on the moufain slopes Yesterday a black bear come up over there I watched at him all morning But the others had the common herders affliction the mind sprung by the weight of the silences against it However slowly and if it could be pried out at all there generally would be news to be heard from the sheepherder a coyote seen on a hillside a ewe gone or ripped by a snag a porcupine treed by his dogs as they suicidally tried to get their faces full of quills Dad if it was his turn at camp tending would smoke and chat until the herder began talking then only nod and ask enough to keep the flow coming McGraths style was to blurt at the man until he at last set off on some startled telling or another the two of them steaming toward full exasperation Then abruptly an instant before the herder was ready to fling his job in McGraths face we would wheel away to move the sheepwagon to a new pasture site The sheepwagon could be seen to be a child of the prairie Doig221 schooner With its rounded canvas top and high spoked wheels a first glance easily found it back amid the beadlike file of wagons westering through our history But a sheepwagon always existed alone remote as a drifting brig on the grass ocean It was built for one man to bide through the narrow months in and that single life only in the mountain dawn or dusk yellowed light from the kerosene lamp at a herders wagon showed like one frail star fallen into the timber Inside the wagon with Dad or McGrath it felt to me as if space the very air had changed somehow tidied and tamped itself I wanted to live in one so much more interesting were they than the blank room back at the Camas Nowhere else had the sense of deft shrinkage as if a house had been pulled in and pulled in until it came down just above your head and out past your fingertips Storage bins doubled as places to sit the table hinged daintily down from a wall when wanted every builtin cabinet had a tiny firm clasp snugging its door The bunk bed fit across the inmost end of the wagon as properly as a blade snicked into a jackknife At the opposite end on a platform all its own sat the small square stove usually with a pan of mulligan stew or a blueenameled pot of sour tarry coffee waiting to be fired up one more time Finally to let the herder glance out more easily to the sheep the wagon had a Dutch door with its bottom half closed I could lean out on it and feel as if far up on a lookout across this high pasture of summer Doig 222 In place the wagon was a kind of ships cabin for the herder tidy buttoned comely But during the move to the next site it became only a floating bin Everything loose had to be packed away in the wagons nooks then onto the floor was piled whatever firewood the herder had chopped his coal oil can and likely a creamery can full of drinking water his wash basin the battered metal dish his dog ate out of the gunnysacked ration of oats f01rhis horse white sacks of salt for the sheep and last of all the small front steps for the doorway Because a sheepwagon sat so high on its running gearlthe f leor nearly chest high to a man on the groundlit M towed across rough country with a staggering topheavy gait A successful move of a sheepwagon was one that didnt topple the pipe and leave it to be searched out of a few miles of roadside brush At the new site there was leveling to be done A cup of water would be put on the table to see how the wagon tilted then small holes were dug for the wheels to drop in or a stout stick was shouldered under a corner of the wagon box to lift it into steadiness for another week Such at least was how a sheepwagon was properly moved McGrath in his headlong way was apt to tow it as if dragging a tree stump More often than not he would forget to fasten the cabinet doors and a flour can would fly out and explode c snowily over everything pots and pans then avalanching on the oven and likely a can of lard or jar of jam leaping in after Doig223 Credit him McGrath always seemed genuinely surprised to fling back the door and find the gooey wreckage For a minute or so he would dab at it doubtfully firing pots and pans back into the oven and kicking flour out the door in tiny puffs then would snort The hell with it a sheepherders got more time than I do and off we would buck to the next sheepwagon move More than two years were spent on the Camas this way the seasons milling into one another like the fitful sheep themselves Dad and Grandma steadied the ranch with their work but had less luck with each other Ours remained a brink of a family the two of them at sudden edge with each other then calming again When they came to take me to the Camas for the weekends with them usually the mood seemed to me as chancy as among McGraths wild sheep1 erders But as the third winter of this was about to begin something vaster to judge came along McGrath had made a proposition He was going to give up the Camas for other ventures and one of them was the lease of a small ranch miles to the north He would put two thousand ewes on the place would Dad run the ranch and the sheep for half the profit None of us had been to that far region of Montana and naturally McGraths prospects were as unpredictable as the country But Dad was for going He took me aside and talked out his reasoning Ivan I think Ill take on those two bands Doig224 of sheep for McGrath Hes a bearcat to work for but the sonofabuck knows livestock and he knows how to turn money I think its a chance to take going up north But I dont know now how do you feel about changing schools Eight weeks earlier I had started high school in White Sulphur with the classmates I had known since Dad and I came away from the mountains after my mothers death The school the town the valley made all the lifestream I knew anything about Yet when I put all this against Dads words and the musing look on his face the sum did not add up to as much as I expected It may have been that I was more weary than I knew of the suitcase life of boarding out in White Sulphur or that I was just now coming across a portion of restlessness inherited from Dad Whatever was behind it I swallowed and gave my father the answer he wanted and apparently the one I secretly did too I feel okay about that Grandma She had lived in the valley for forty years now nearly all her adult life Her friends her sons her patterns of existence were there The alliance between Dad and her had problems which showed no sign of easing Whatever the ties of affection between her and me I couldnt believe she qould be talked into this total uprooting toward the north Well iust have to see about her Dad said He rehearsed to me a dozen arguments he would put to her and when the moment Doig 225 came simply fired out This damn yalley has never got us much of anywhere Lady All either of us has to show for our lives here is a helluva pile of hard work T saX we to try country Will ye c ome She was silent a long whileMbut a thinking silence not a perturbed one At last All right then When can we be gone and get it ove r a na done with The two of us watched struck silent as she honked into a handkerchief and then clouted pots and pans onto the counter for the next kitchen chore She was truly corded to us now and the fact came with a sense of wonder and relieffand somehow among them a nudge of concern Doig 226 one shard of repeats itself like the snowhelmets of mountains across each season of my memory An edged piece of the day that is in the strictest sensethe high M called noon It seems curious now that this one daily interval counted for so much Daybreak did not nor dusk days arrived and went with an unnoticed ease then But noon climbed up like a crier to a tower and my father reckoned his life and those of his ranch crews and mine at his side by its powers After noon well just go and get this by noon Better noon up and get some grub dont ye t hink And my grandmother noon meaning to her the vast micjay meall1 we called it dinner in full honorjto be arrayed along the sweep of table for a lambing crew or a shearing crew or a haying crew or whatever other kinds of crew might turn up from the world Ivan pretty please to cail those goodfornothins in here Noon it was too when Taylor Gordon might be met on the street in White Sulphur on the way to his cabin for his own dreaming meal and turning back at you to leave one last New York story or particle of philosophy You know Ive found in life that Id make a fast dime than a slow buck Or when Harold Chadwick straddled onto a counter stool in the Dupuyer cafe might be coaxed to tell of hunting elk when he was my age with the ancient mountain man Toussaint Salois He had his Doig 227 big old buffalo coat and could set by the campfire just as comfortable5the rest of us d be freezin to death Even my mother the one voice unknown from any of these years can be almostheard in some noontime talking as she would have with my father as their mornings harvest of grouse sizzle on the campfire of their Grass Mountain herding site For so potent a piece of time noon was not exact at all It never meant to us high twelve oclock any more than to the early English countryfolk who accounted their noon at three pm the ninth hour after sunrise Noon meant instead the controlled curve of the day from morning into afternoon where the beginning of labor crossed into the lessening of labor A gradual but distinct that is to say which the sundial still could have expressed better than the clock There would have been the advantage too that the blankness of the sundial on an overcast day would have said how vague time became when clouds curded grayly over the valley and all work of the ranch was drenched out Once or twice I can remember a t woday rain which was all the rain we could imagine and the loss of two workingnoons in a row was befuddling ominous a dank eclipse More than enough testimony each time that the suns topmost moments of arch stood as a necessity in our world of ranchcraft aia a second and special service f or me iR d s way even than the majestic division of time It Doig 228 inctured all that I saw after it Beyond that equator of the land itself began to change for me Some of the pitiless midday wash of light began to be drawn out of it could be seen fleeing in the of heat up from the mown fields Past noon as a pair of hours and then another and another were added there came a honeyed light richer more golden I stand yet on the lionback ridge above the Two Medicine Gorge or in the shade of an alfalfa stack at the Camas ranch or on the back of a tractor amid the flung horizon of plains beyond the Milk River and always to the west the noonloosed tint is doing its magic As a boy I prized the trick having unearthed it in one book or anotherlof estimating the remainder of daylight bystacking my hands held carefully vertical as tiny walls and at from my eyes between the line of horizon and the sun each finger equaling ten minutes of daylight a hand and two fingers signaling a full hour yet before sunset Taking such sightings of time I watched the backdrop of earth make its changes Mountains always grew in dignity as the sun approached them drew up their profiles more boldly loftier than an instant before The nap of sage or the chamois expanses of bunchgrass doubled in distinctness of tone And the hills for there were always hills offered above the prairie as if they were the earths roofbeams and dikes and parapets and always to the west of Doig 229 the inclining mi ection of Montana had begun its drop of day across them the hills c ran sheltering lines ever longer and bolder and nearer It comes to me a chi 1 dhood fasoina mislaid in memorythat my father was colorblind I proftded him on that when I was a boy trying to find out if he saw everything in gray l1 I imagined a blackwandwhite movie flashing before hi s eyes or in tan or the Ye 11 ow of o 1 d newspapers or exact 1 y I what Not having the of hue of course he could not tell me what colorations did enter his eyes Skavinsky yed have to get in here and have a look for yourself to savvy it I am left to wonder now that is beyond determining whether he the days shadings west of noon in any way as I did
