 1 This time of year the report from the dust counties in the northeastern part of the state customarily has it that Lady Godiva could ride through the streets there without even the horse seeing her But this springs rains are said to have thinned the air sufficiently to give the steed a glimpse Gros Ventre Weekly Gleaner June 1 That month of June swam into the Two Medicine country In my life until then I had never seen the sidehills come so green the coulees stay so spongy with runoff A right amount of wet evidently could sweeten the universe Already my father on his first high patrols was encountering cow elk drifting up and across the Continental Divide to their calving grounds on the west side They and the grass and the hay meadows and the benchland alfalfa all were a good three weeks ahead of season Which of course accounted for the fresh mood everywhere across the Two As is always said spring rain in range country is as if halves of 10 bills are being handed around with the other halves promised at shipping time And so in the English Creek sheepmen what few cowmen were left along Noon Creek and elsewhere the outeast farmers the storekeepers of Gros Ventre our Forest Service people in just everyone that start of June hope was up and would stay strong as long as the grass did Talk could even be heard that Montana maybe at last had seen the bottom of the Depression After all the practitioners of this 2 bottomedout notion went around pointing out last year was a bit more prosperous or anyway a bit less desperate than the year before A nice near point of measurement which managed to overlook that for the several years before lastthe situation of people on the land out here had been godawful I suppose I ought not to dwell on dollar matters when actually our family was scraping along better than a good many Even though during the worst years Forest Service did lay off some peopleHoovered them the saying wentmy father ranger Varick McCaskill was never among them True his salary was jacked down a couple of times and Christ only knew if the same wasnt going to start happening again But we were getting by Nothing extra just getting by It gravels me every time I read a version of those times that makes it sound as if the Depression set in on the day Wall Street tripped over itself in 1929 Talk about nearsighted By 1929 Montana already had been on rocky sledding for ten years The winter of men my fathers age and older still just called it that sonofabitch of a wirtter4was the one that delivered hard times Wholesale As Dode Withrow who had the ranch farthest up the south fork of English Creek used to tell I went into that 19 winter with four thousand head of ewes and by spring theyd evaporated to five hundred Trouble never travels lonesome so about that same time livestock and crop prices nosedived because of the end of the war in Europe And right along with that drought and grasshoppers showed up to take over the dryland farming It began to be just a hell of a situation my father always summed up 3 thoseyears whenhe and my mother were trying to get a start in life Anyplace you looked you saw people who had put twenty years into this country and allthey had to show for it was a pile of old calendars Then when drought circled back again at the start of the Thirties and joined forces with Herbert Hoover bad progressed to worse That is within my own remembering those dry bitter yeals Autumn upon autumn the exodus stories kept coming out of the High Line grain country to the north and east of us and right down here on the highway which runs through the townof Gros Ventre anybody who looked could see for self the truth of those tales the furnitureloaded jitney trucks with farewells to Montana painted across their boxboards in big crooked letters GOODBY OLD DRY and AS FOR HAVRE YOU CAN HAVE ER The Two country did have the saving grace that the price for lambs and wool recovered somewhat while other livestock and crops stayed sunk But anybody on Two land who didnt scrape through the early Thirties with sheep likely didnt scrape through at ail Cattle rancher after cattle rancher and farmer after farmer got in deep with the banks Gang plow and ditcher work horses and harness haymow and cream separator everything on those places was mortgaged except the air And then foreclosure and the auctioneers hammer At those hammer sales we saw men weep women as stricken as if they were looking on death and their children bewildered Soit was time hope showed Jick Set your mouth for it 4 Supper and my It is indelible in me that all this began there right at the very outset of June because I was working over my saddle and lengthening the stirrups to account for how much I had grown in the past year for the ride up with my father on the counting trip the next morning I can even safely say what the weather was one of those brockle late afternoons under the Rockies when tagends of storm cling in the mountains and sun is reaching through wherever it can between the cloud piles Tell me why it is that details like that saddle stirrups a notch longer than last year or sunshine dabbed around on the foothills some certain way seem to be the allowance of memory while the points of life hang At least I have found it so particularly now that I am at the time where I try to think what my life might have been like had I not been born in the Two Medicine country and into the McCaskill family Oh I know whats said How home ground and kin together lay their touch along us as unalterably as the banks of a stream direct its water But that doesnt mean you cant wonder Whether substantially the same person would meet you in the mirror if your birth certificate didnt read as it Or whether some other place of growing up might have turned you wiser or dumber more contented orles Here in my own instance some mornings I will catch myself with qfull cup of coffee yet in my hand gone cold while I have my sat here stewing about years would be pretty much as they are by now had I happened into existence in say China or California instead of northern Montana Any of this of course goes against what my mother forever tried 5 other to tell of That the past is a taker not a Lt was a warning she felt she had to put out in that particular tone of voice with punctuation all through it fairly often in our family When we could start hearing her connrias and capital letters we knew the topic had become Facing Facts Not Going Around with our Heads Stuck in Yesterday Provocation for it I will say came from my father as reliably as a dusk wind out of a canyon Half a night at a time he might spend listening to Toussaint Rennie tell of the roundup of 1882 when the cowmen fanned their crews north from the elbow of the Teton River to the Canadian line and brought in a hundred thousand head Orthe tale even bigger and earlier than that the last great buffalo hunt Toussaint having ridden up into the Sweetgrass Hills to see down onto a prairie that looked burnt so dark with buffalo the herd pinned into place by the plains Strange but I can still recite the tribes and where they pitched their camps to surround those miles of buffalo just as Toussaint passed the lore of it to my fath r Crows on the southeast Gros Ventres and Assiniboines on the northeast Piegans on the west Crees along the north and Flatheadshere to the south Something to see that mustve been my father would say in his recounting to the rest of us at supper Mac somebody already saw it my mother would come right back at him What youd better Put Your Mind To is the Forest Supervisors Visit Tomorrow Or if she didnt have to work on my father for the moment there was Alec when he began wearing a neck hanky and considering himself a cowboy That my own particular knack for remembering which 6 could tuck away entire grocery lists or whatever someone had told me in innocence a couple of weeks before made me seem likely to round out a houseful of men tilted to the past must have been the final stem on her load Jick I can hear her yet there isnt any law that says a McCaskill cant be as forwardlooking as anybody else Just because your father and your brother0 Yet I dont knqw What we say isnt always what we can do In the time after it was her more than anyone who would return and return her thoughts to where all four of our lives made their bend The stimmer when she would start in and as if the threenote signal of a chickadee had been sung it told me she was turning to some happening of that last Creek summer She and I were alike at least in that the understanding that such a season of life provides more than enough to wonder back at even for a McCaskill JICK Are you coming or do the chickens get your share I know with all certainty too that that call to supper was double because I was there at the age where I had to be called twice for Anyway that second summons of hers brought me out of the barn just as the pair of them Alec and Leona topped into view at the eastern rise of the county That is I knew my brother as far as I couldsee him by that headup way he rode as if trying to see beyond a ridgeline in front of him Leona would need to be wliat nearer before I could verify her by her blouseful But those days if you saw Alecyouwere pretty sure tobe seeing Leona tqo Although therewere few things more certain to hold my eyes than 7 a rider rise of road with allthe level eastern horizon under him as if he was traveling out of the sky and then the outline of him and his horse in gait down and down and down the steady slow slant toward the forks of English Creek I did my watching of Alec and Leona as I crossed the yard to our house behind the ranger station I knew better than to have my mother call me time number three I went on in to wash up and I suppose was a little more deliberately offhand than I had to be by waiting until Id dippered water into the basin and added hot from the kettle before announcing Company The word always will draw an My father looked up from where he was going over paperwork about the grazers allotments and my mothers eyebrows drew into that alignment that let you knew you had all of her attention and had better be worth it Alec and Leona I reported through a face rinse Riding like the prettiest one of them gets to kiss the other one You seem to know a remarkable lot about it my mother said Actually that sort of thing was starting to occur to I was fourteen and just three months shy of my next birthday Fourteen hard on to fifteen as I once heard one of the beerhounds around the Medicine Lodge saloon in Gros Ventre describe thatcomplicated age But there wasnt any of this I was about to confide to my mother who now instructed When youre done there youd better bring in that spare chair from your bedroqm She cast the pots and pans atop the stove a calculating look then as if having reminded herself turned toward me and added Please When I left the room she already had rattled 8 a fresh stickofwood into the kitchen range and was starting in on whatever it is cooks like her do to connive food for three into a supper for five Remind me irf the overhear my father say to do the rest of this Uncle Sam Illserve it to you with breakfast promised my mother Fried he said Done to a cinder would suit me particularly Van Bebbers allotment Itd save me arguing the Section Twenty grass with him one goddamn more tiJne You wouldnt know how to begin a summer without that argument with Ed she answered Are you washed By the time I came back into the kitchen with the spare chair which had been serving as my nightstand Alec and Leona were arriving through the doorway him inquiring Is this the McCaskill shortorder house and her beaming up at him as if hed just recited Shakespeare They were a pair to look on Alec and Leoa By now Alec was even taller than my father and had the same rich red head of hair a bloodsorrel flame which several hundred years of kilts and skirts being flung off must have fanned into creation Same lively blue Same straight keen McCaskill nose and same tendency to freckle across it but nowhere ele Same deep upper lip with the bottom of the face coming out to meet it in stubborn support with mouth closed both Alec and my father had that look which meets life like a plow Resemblance isnt necessarily duplication though and I see in my minds eye that there also was themessage of that as promptly as my brother and my father were in the same room that evening Where my 9 father never seemed to take up as much space as his size might warrant Alec somehow took up his share and thens01ne L noticed this now how Alec hadbegun to stand in that shambly wishbone way a cowboy adopts legs and knees spraddled farther apart than they need to be as if ing to theworld that hes sure longing for a horse to trot in there between Alec was riding for the Double W ranch his second summer as a hand there and it had caused some family ructionhis going back to cowboying instead of taking a betterpaying job such as driving a truck for Adam Kerz as my mother particularly But the past year or so Alec had had to shut off his ears to a lot of opinions my parents had about this cowboy phase of hLs Last Fourth of July when Alec showed up in rodeo clothes which included a red bandanna my father asked him nWhat is your Adams apple cold Not that you could ever dent Alec for long I have told that he had a headup nothinginlifehaseverslowedmeupyet way of riding I maybe sfiould amend that to say that on horseback Alec looked as if he was riding the world itself and even afoot as he was here in the kitchen he seemed as if he was being carried to exactly where he wanted to go Which just then I guess you would have to say he Wqs Everything was coming up aces for Alec that yeqr Beating Earl Zanes time with Leona Riding for the Double W this green highgrass And in the fall he would be headed for Bozeman the first McCaskill to manage to go to college Launching Alec to college from the canyon of the Depression was taking great exerting by our whole family but his knack for numbers plainly justifiedit we none of us that four years from now he would step out of Bozeman 10 Yes Alec was adoer aspeople said of him My own earliest memory of this brother of mine was the timeI must have been four and him when he took me into the pasture where the ranger stations saddle horses were grazing and said Heres how you mooch them Jick He eased over to the nearest horse waited until it put its head down to eat grass then straddled its neck When the horse raised its head Alec was lifted and slid down the neck into place on its back and simultaneously gripped the mane to hang on and steer Qy Now you mooch that mare Alec called to me and I went beside the big chomping animal and flung my right leg over as he had and was elevated into being a bareback rider the same as my Lo Jicker Alec said across the kitchen to me now after his greeting to my mother and father Hows the world treating you Just right I said back automatically Lo Leona Leona too was a horseperson I guess youd call it these days When Tallie Zaneheld his auction of freshbroke saddle horses in Gros Ventre every year he always enlisted Leona to ride them into the auction ring because there is nothing that enhances a saddle pony more than a goodlooking girl up there on his back Right now though entering my mothers kitchen Leonas role was to be milk and honey Which she also was firstrate at A kind of pause stepped in with Leona whenever she arrived somewhere a long breath or two or maybe eventhree during which everyone seemed to weigh whether her hair couldreally be so gold whether her figure actually lived up to all it advertised on f irst glance I managed to notice once that her chin 11 was pointier than I like but bythe time any male lookedLeona over encugh to reach that site he was prepared to discount that and a lot more Anyhow there in the kitchen we went through that pause period of letting Leonas looks bask over us all and on into some nickel and dime gab between Alec and my fatherWorking hard Well sure Dqd Ever see me do anything different Just times Ive seen you hardly worklrg The Double W sees against that Yknow what they say N obody on the Double Wever gets a sunburn they dont have time and an oldaswomankind kitchen ritual between Leona and my motherCan I help with anything McCaskill No probably its beyond heip until shortly my mother was satisfied that she had multiplied the food on the stove sufficiently ana T I expect you brought your appetites with you Lets sit I suppose every household needs some habited way to begin a meal I have heard the Lord thanked in some of the unlikeliest of homes and for some of the unholiest of food And seen whole families not lift a fork until the patriarch at the head of the table had his plate full and his bread Ours though said grace only once every three hundred sixtyfive days and that one a jokemy fathers New Years Eve invocation in that Scotchpreacher burr he could put on We ask ye on this Hogmanay gi us a new yearrr o white brread and nane o 1 yourrr grray 12 Other than that a McCaskill meal started at random the only tradition to help yourself to what was closest and pass the food on clockwie Hows cow chousing My father was handing the mashed potatoes to Leona but looking across at Alec Its all right Alec meanwhile was presenting the gravy to Leona before he realized she didnt yet have spuds on her plate He colored a little but notched out his jaw and then asked back Rows rangering When my father was a boy a stick of kindling flew up from the axe andstruckthe corner of his left eye The vision was saved but ever after that eyelid would droop to about halfshut whenever amusement made him squint a littie It descended now as he studied the meal traffic piling up around Then he made his reply to Alec Its all right I had the bright idea this conversation could benefit from my help so Ichimed in Counting starts tomorrow Alec Dodes sheep and then Walter Kyles and then Fritz Dad and Ill be up there a couple three days Remember that time you and I were along with him and Fritzs herders dog Moxie got after a skunk and we both Alec gaveme a grin that was tighter than it ought to have been from a brother Dont let all those sheep put you to sleep sprout Sprout Evidently there was no telling what might issue from a persons mouth when he had a blond girl to show off in front of and 13 the look Isent Alec told hiID 0 Speaking of counting Alec came up with next you got your beavers counted yet Here he was giving my father a little static Every so of ten the Forest Service regional headquarters in Mazoola all of us pronounced it my fathers way emphasis on the zooinvented some new project for rangers to cope with and the latest one we had been hearing about from my father was the inventory he was posed to take of the beaver population of English Creek Christamighty he had grumped this creek is the beaver version of New York City Now though with Leona on handthis was the first time Alec had brought her out for a meal the rest of us in the family recognized it as an early phase a sort of curtainraiser in the Alec style of courtingmy father just passed off the beaver census with No Im waiting for guidance from the Mazoola inmates They might want me tocount only the tails and then multiply by one you never know Alec didnt let it go though Maybe if they like your beaver arithmetic next summer theyll have you do fih Maye My father was Alec more prancing room than he deserved but I guess Leona justified it Whos this weeks cook at the Double W My mother hete Leona takesome more ham and pass it on to Jick He goes through food like a oneman army these daysu I might have protested that too if my plate hadnt been nearly empty particularly of fried A Mrs Pennyman Alec reported From over around Havre By now its Havre is it If Wendell Williamson keeps on hell 14 have hired and fired every cook between here and Chicago My mother paused for Alecs response to that and got noe So she prompted How does she feed Itsfilling The question seemed to put Alec a little off balance and I noticed Leona provide him a little extra wattage in her next gaze at hi111 So is sawdust said my mother plainly awaiting considerably more Yeah well Alec I was beginning to wonder whether cowboying had dinnned his wits maybe driven his backbone up through the judgment part of his brain You know its usual ranch grub He sought down into his plate for further description and finally proclai111ed again Filling is what Id call it Hows the buttermilk business my father asked Leona I suppose to steer matters off Alecs circular traGk Her parents the Tracys ran the creamery in Gros Just fine Leona responded along with her flash of smile She seemed to be on the brink of saying a lot more but then just passed that smile around to the rest of us a full share to my father and another to my mother and then one to me that made my throat tighten a little then letting it rest last and coziest on Alec She had a natural ability at that producing some pleasantry then lighting up the room so you thought the remark amounted to a whole hell of a lot more than it did I do envy that knack in a person though likely wouldnt have the patience to useit myself even if I hadtt 15 Westillwere getting usedtothe idea of Leona the three of us in the familybesides Alec His girlsbeforeherwere fromthe ranch families in here under the mountains or from the farm folks east of Gros Ventie Nor was Leona in circulationat all for the past few years going with Tallie Zanes son Earl as she had been But this past spring Alecs last in high school and Leonas nexttolast he somehow cut Earl Zane out of the pictuie Swap one cowboy for another she might as well have stayed put my mother said at the a bit perturbed with Alec anyway about his intention for the Double W summer job again All right I guess Alec was answering profoundly to some question of my fathersabout how successful the Double Ws calving season had turned Hows this hows that fine all you bet If this was the level of sociability that was going to go on I intended to damn promptly excuse myself to get back to working on my saddle the scenic attractions of Leona notwithstanding But then just as I was trying butterscotch merin ue to estimate ahead to whether an early pie could be coaxed from my mother or Id do better to wait until later Alec all at once put down his fork and came right out with We gotsomething to tell you Were going to get married This kicked the conversation in the head entirely My father seemed to have forgotten about the mouthful of coffee hed just drunk while my mother looked as if Alec had announced he intendedto take a pee in the middle of the table Alec was trying 16 to watch both of them at once and Leona was favoring us all with one of her searchlight How come Even yet L dont know why L said thqt L mean I was plenty old enough to know why people got married There were times recently seeing Alec and Leona mooning aroundtogether when L seemed to savvy more than L actually had facts about if thats possible Focused as he was on how our parents were going to respond the philosophy question from my side of the table jangled Alec Because because we love each other why the hell do you think Kind of soon in life to be so certain on that isnt it suggested my father We re old encugh Alec shot back And meanwhile gave me a snakekilling look as if I was going to ask old enough for what but I honestly didnt intend to Whens allthis taking place my father got out next This fall Alec looked ready to say more then held on to it finally just delivered it in one dump Wendell Williamson 11 let us have the house on the Nansen place to live in Lt was up to my mother to cleave matters entirely open Youre saying youll stay on at the Double W this fall Yeah Alec said as if taking a vqw Its what I want to do The unsaid part of this was huge huger than anything I had ever felt come into our kitchen befoJe The to send Alec to Bozeman my parents had gathering like quilt pieces whatever 17 savings the household managed to pinch aside plus a loan from mymothers brother Pete Reese plus a joo which my father had set up for Alec with a range management professor at the college who knew us from having spent time up here studying the Two plus of course Alecs own wages from this sunnner which was another reason why his choice of the Double W riding job at 30 a month again was less than popular ChristmDighty since my own haying wages later this sunnner would go into the general household kitty even I felt I had a stake in the man plan And now here was Alec choosing against college Against all the expectation riding on him AgainstAlec you will End Up as Nothing More Than a GimpedUp Saddle Stiff and Ifor one Will Not Moreout of samaritan instinct than good sense my father headed my mother off with a next query to Alec How you going to support yourselves on a cow chousers wages You two did at firt Westarved out at it too We aint going to starve Alecs grammar seemed to be cowhoyilying tqo Wendellll let me draw ahead on my wages for a few heifers this fall and winter them with the rest of the outfits Itll give us our stalt My father finally thought to set down his coffee cup Alec lets keep ourshirts on here language can be odd I had the vision just then of usall sitting around the table with our shirts off Leona across fromme in full douolebarreled displayand try see whats what 18 I dont see theres anywhatswhat about it Alec People get married every day So does the sun rise my mother told him without particular participation by you Mom now damn it listen We all better listen my father tried again Leona we got nothing against you You know thqt11 Which was a bit short of true in both its parts but Leona responded with a lower beam of smile Its just that Godamighty Alec cattle have gone bust time after time these last years That way of life just has Even the Double W would be on hard times if Wendell Williamsons daddy hadnt left him such deep pockets h1tether anybodyll ever be able to start off from scratch in the cow business and make a go of it I dont see how Alec was like any of us he resisted having an idea pulled from under kpn Rather have me herding sheep up on one of your ments you Thered be something substantial to look forward to I suppose you think sheepherding My father seemed to consider No most probably not in your ca9e It takes a trace of common sense to herd He said it lightly enouglt that Alec would have to take it as a joke but there was a poking edge to the Alec I just think that whatever the hell youdo you need to bring an education to it these days That old stuff of banging a out of this country by sheer force of behavior doesnt work Hasnt for almost twenty years This country 19 can outbang any rnqno Look at them along this creek even these sheepmen Hahn Ed VanBebber Pres Rozier the Busbys Dode Withrow Finletter Hillo Theyve alljust managed to hang on and theyre as good a set of stockmen as youll find in this whole goddamn stateo You think any of them could have got underway in years like thereve been Lastyear was better than the one before Alec defended with that litany of the local optimistso This one looks better yeto I saw my father glance at my mother to see if she wanted to swat down this part of Alecs argument or whether he should go aheado Even I couldtell from the heldin look of her that once she got started thered be no stopping so he soldiered on And if about five more come good backtoback everybodyll be almost to where they were fifteen or twenty years ago Alec trying to build a living on a few head of stock is a dead end these days DadDad listen We aint starting from fifteen or twenty years ago Were starting from now and we got to go by that not whatever thehell happened toto anybody ele Youll be starting in a hole my father warnedo And an lasting climb ottto I say warned What rang through tome was an alarm different from the one in my fathers wordsan iron tone of anger such as I had never heardout of him before Thatsas maybe Alecs timbre was an echo of the anger the iron But wegot tostaJt Now Alec was looking at Leona as if he was storing up for the next thousand yeaJs And were going to do it married Not 20 going to waitour life away Lf Iever get old enough to have brains I will work on the question of man and woman All those years ago the topic rode with me into the next morning as my father and I set off from the ranger station toward the mountains Cool but cloudless the day was a decent enough one except for windo I ought to have been in a topnotch mood elevated by the anticipation that alwaysbegan with my fathers annual words Put on your mountain clothes in the morning Goingalong on one of these startofJune rides with my father as he took a count onthe sheep summering on the various ranchers range allotments in the national forest was one of the awaited episodes of life Better country to look ahead to could not be asked for Kootenai Lalo Flathead Absaroka Bitterroot Beaverhead Deerlodge Gallatin Cabinet Helena Lewis and Clark Custer Two Medicinethose were the national forests of Montana totaling dozens of ranger districts but to our estimation the Two Medicine was head and shoulders above the others and my fathers English Creek district the topknot of the Twoo Anybody with eyes could see this at once for our ride that morning led up the North Fork of English Creek which actually angles mostly west and Rooster west to thread between Roman Reef and and where the coulee of the North Fork opened ahead of us there the first summits of the Rockies sat on thehorizon like sharp Only when our first hour or so of riding carried us above 21 that west edge of the coulee would we see the mountains in total their broad bases of timber and rockfall gripping into the foothills And the reef so Roman Reef ahead of us a rimrock half a mile high and more than three long Grizzly Reef even bigger to the south of it smaller Jericho Reef to the north I dont know are mountain reefs general knowledge in the world I suppose they get their name because they stand as pings do at the edge of an oceansteady level ridges of stone as if to give a calm example to the waves beyond them Except that in this case the bluegray billow up there is not waves but the Continental Divide against thesky The name aside though sections of afortress wall were what the three reefs reminded me of spaced as they were with canyons between them and the higher jagged crags penned up behind As if the whole horizon of the west had once been barricaded with slabs of rock and these were the mighty traces still standing I must not have been the only onlooker this occurredto as an even longer barrier of cliff farther south in the national forest was named the Chinese Wall The skyline of the Two Even here at the outset the hover of it all always caused my father to turn and appreciatively call over his shoulder to Alec and me something like Nothing the matter with that And always Alec and I would chorus Not one thing both because we were expected to andbecause we too savored those waiting mountains Always was not in operation thisyear however My father did not pause to pronounce on the scenery I had no chance to echo him and Alec this year was on our minds instead of riding between So our firststint on the road up the North Fork was broken only 22 by the sound of our horses hooves or one or the other of us muttering a horse name and urging a little more stepalong in the pace Even those blurts of sound were pretty pallid because where horse nomenclature was concerned my fathets imagination took a vacation A black horse he invariably named Coaly a blaze face was always Star Currently he was riding a big mousecolored gelding who depend on it bore the title of Moueo I was on a shortlegged mare called Ponyo Frankly high among my hopes about the business of growing up was that I would get a considerably more substantial horse out of it If and when I did I vowed to give the creature as much name as it could carry such as Rimfire or Chief Joseph or Calabah Whether I was sorting through my horse hopes or the outset of this counting trip without Alec weighed more heavily on me than I realized I dont know But in either case I was so deep into myself that I was surprised to glance ahead and learn that Mouse and my father were halted and my father was gandering back to see what had become of meo I rode on up and found that we had arrived to where a set of rutted tracksin flattery it could have been called almost a roadleft the North Fork roadbed and crossed the coulee and creek and traced on up the side of Breed Butte to where a few log buildings could be seen Normally from my father about sunburning my eyeballs if Iwent open like that But this day he was looking businesslike which was the way he looked only when he couldnt find any better mood How about you taking a squint at Walters place he proposed You cancut around the butte 23 and meet me at the road into the Hebner tribe All right I of course agreed o And turned Pony to fallow the ruts down and across the North Fork swale Walter Kyle always summered in the mountains as herder of his own sheep and so my father whenever he rode past veered in to see that everything was okay at the empty rancho This was the first time he had delegated me which verified just how much his mdnd was burdenedalso with that question of man and woman at least as it pertained to Alec McCaskill and Leona Tracyand that he wanted to saunter alone a while as he sorted through it allo I suppose one school of thought is that I have an overdrawn imaginationo Yet answer me this how can the farthest reaches of life be gotten to except by way of the mind I stop to say this because otherwise what I did next might sound odd For as soon as my father had gone his way and I was starting up Breed Butte I turned myself west in my saddle to face Roman Reef tapped the brim of my hat in greeting and spoke in the slow and distinct way you talk to a deaf person Lo Walter Hows everything up on the Reef What was involved here was that from Walter Kyles summer range up there in the mountains on top of Roman Reef a good five miles from where I was his actual house and outbuildings here on Breed Butte could be seen through his spyglass Tiny but seen Walter had shown Alec and me this stunt of vision whenwe took some mail up to him during last years counting trip There ye go he congratulated as each of us in turn managed to extend the telescopetubejust so and sight the building specks Ye can see foras long as your eye holds out in this countryo 24 Walters enthusiasm for the Two was that of a person newly smitten for although he was the most elderly of all the English Creek at the time he seemed to me downright ancient I suppose partly because he was one of those driedup little guys who look eternalhe also was much the most recent to the area Only three or four years ago Walter had moved here from down in the Ingamar country in the southeastern part of the state where he ran several bands of sheepo I have never heard of a setup like it before or since but Walter and a number of other Scotch sheepmen dedicated bachelors all lived there in the hotel in Ingemar and operated their sheep outfits out of their back pocket and hat you might say Not one of them possessed a real ranch just grazing land theyd finagled one way or another plus wagons for their herders and of course sheep and moresheep Away each of those old Scotchies would go once a week out from that hotel with boxes of groceries in the back of a Model T to tend campo For whatever reason Walter pulled out of hotel sheep father speculated that one morning he turned to the Scotclnnan beside him at the table and burred Jock for thirrty yearrs yevebeen eating yourrr oatmeal aye too loud got up and left for and bought the old Barclay place here on Breed Butte for next to nothing Pony was trudging up the butte in her steady uninspired way and I had nothing to do but continue my long distance conversation with Walter Not that I figured there was any real chance that Walter would be studying down here exactly then and even if he was Iwouldbe only a gnat in the spyglass lenses and certainly not a conversationalist on whom he could perform any lip reading But for whatever reason I went ahead 25 and queried in the direction of the distant reef Walter how the hell do people get so crosswise with one another For last nights rumpus continued to bedevil me from whatever angle I could find to view Lto The slantat which Alec and my parents suddenly were diverging from each other first of allo In hindsight it may not seem such an earthquake of an issue whether Alec was going to choose college or thewedding bandriding job combinationo But hindsight is always through bifocals it peers specifically instead of seeing whole And the entiretyhere was that my father and my mother rested great hopes on my brother especially given all that they and others of their the De ression tion had endured in the years past years they had gotten through by constantly saying withinthemselves Our children will know better timeso Theyve got too Hopes of that sort only parents can know That Alec seemed not to want to step up in life now that the chance at last was here went against my parents thinking as much as if hed declared he was going to go out on the prairie and dig a hole and live a gophers existenGeo Walter Kyle had seen a lot of life his mustatrnA mubt have been sandy in his youth now was as yellowwhite as if hed been drinking cream from a jar What about that Walter From your experience has Alec gone as goofy as my folks think And got back instead of Walters long Scotch view of life my fathers briefer Scotch one his last nights reasoning to Alec Why not give college ayear and then see You got the ability its a crime not to use ito And Bozeman isnt the moon Youll be back and forth some timesduring the yearo The two of you can 26 see how the marriage notion holds up after thqt But Alec wasnt about to have time bought from himo Were not waiting our life away ran his constant response Our life that convergence of Alec and Leona and the headlong enthusiasm which none of the rest of us had quite realized they were bringing to their romance Well it will happen Two people who have been around each other for years and all of a sudden finding that nobody else in history has ever been in love before theyre inventing it themselves Yet apply my mind to it in all the ways I could my actual grasp of their mood wasnt tfiat firm for to me then marriage seemed about as distant as death Nor did I understand much more about the angle of Leona andI was going to say of Leona and my parents but actually of Leona and the other three of us for I somehow liq feel included into the bask she aimed around our kitchen I will admit it was an interesting sensation collecting an occasional gleam off Leona as if Id abruptly been promoted beyond fourteenyearoldhood A battlefield connnission so to speqk Leona Leona Now there is a topic I could really stand to talk to you about Walter Yet maybe a bachelor was not the soundest source either Perhaps old Walter Kyle knew only enough about women as the saying goes to stay innnuneo Well anyhow with all care and good will I was trying to think through our family situation in a straight line but Leona brought me to a blind curveo Not nearly the least of last evenings marvels was how much ground Leona had been able to hold with only a couple of honesttogoodness sentenceso mien my father and motherwere trying to argue delay into Alec and turned to her to test the result she said just We think we re 27 ready enough And then at the endof the fracas goingout the door Leona turned to bestow my mother one of her sunburst smiles and say Thank you for supper Beth And my mother saying back just as literally Dont mention Lt The final line of thought from last night was the most disturbing of all The breakage between my father and This one bothered me somuch I couldnt even pretend to be confiding it to Walter up there on Roman Stony silence from that source was more than I couldstand on this one For if Id had to forecast say at about the point Alec was announcing marriage intentions my mother was the natural choice to bring the house down on him That would have been expected it was her wayo And she of course did make herself more than amply known on the collegemarriage score But the finale of that suppertime was allmale McCaskill Youre done running my life flung by Alec as he stomped out with Leona in tow and Nobodys running it including you from my father to Alecs baGk Done running my lireo Nobodys running it including youo Put that way the words without the emotion it may sound like something concluding itself the moment of an argument breaking off into a point at which contention has been expendedo But I know now and I somehow knew even then that the fracture of a family isnot a thing that happens clean and sharp so thatyou at least can calculate that from here on it will begin tobeover with No it is like one of those worst bone breaks a You cari mend the place pegit and splint 28 it and work to strengthen it and while the surface maybe can be brought to look much as it did before the deeper vicinity of shatter always remains a spot that has to be favored So if I didnt grasp much of what abruptly was happening within our family I at least held the realization that last nights rift was nowhere near over Thinking heavily that way somehow speeds up time and before I quite knew it Pony was stopping at the barbwire gate into Walter Kyles yard I tied her to the fence on a long rein so she could graze a little and slid myself between the top and second strands Walters place looked hunkydory But I did a circle of the tool barn and the shed sheltering Walters coupe be sure and then went to the front of the house and took out the key from behind the loose piece of chinking which hid it The house too was undisturbed Not that there was all that much in it to invite disturbance The sparse habits of hotel living apparently still were in Waltero Besides the furnituredamn little of that beyond the kitchen table and its chairs of several stiffback varietiesand the open shelves of provisions and cookery the only touches of habitation were a drugstore calendar and aseries of coats hung on nails and one framed studio photograph of a young young Walter in a tunic and a fur cap after Scotland and before Montana he had been a Mountie for a few years up in Alberta 29 All in all except for the stale feel that unlivedin rooms give off Walter might just have stepped out to go down there on the North Fork and fish a beaver dqm A good glance around was all the place requiredo Yet I stood and inventoried for some minutes I dont know why but an empty house holds me Asif it was an opened book about the person living thereo Peruse this logandchinking room and Walter Kyle could be read as thrifty tidy to the verge of fussy and alone At last just to stir the air in the place with some words I said aloud the conclusion of my oneway conversation with the mustached little sheepman up on the Reef Walter youd have made somebody a good wifeo Pony and I now cut west along the flank of Breed Butte which would angle us through Walters field to where we would rejoin the North Fork road and my father Up here above the North Fork coulee the outlook roughened the mountains now in full rumpled view and the foothills bumping up below them and Roman Reef making its wide stockade of bare stone between the two On this part of our route the land steadily grew more beautiful which in Montana also means more hostile to settlement From where I rode along this high ground Walter Kyles was the lone surviving ranch to be looked back on between here and the English Creek ranger stationo The wind seemed to thinkthat was one too many for it had come up from the west and was pummeling everything on Walters property including llle I rode now holding onto my hat withone hand lest it skitter down to the North Fork and set sail for St Louis o Of all of the number of 30 matters about the Two countrythat I never have nor will be able to savvyone life is not nearly enough to do soa main one is why in a landscape with hills and buttes and benchlands everywhere a person is so seldom shelterea from the everlasting damn wind I mean having the wind forever trying to blow harmonica tunes through your rib cage just naturally wears on the nerves Someone like Ed Van Bebber whose ranch lay up the South Fork of English Creek next to the ranger station couldnt even be said hello to until he positioned himself with a building between him and the wind and then Ed would cuss about how much of it was ing him around the corner Of course not everybody is that strung out by the I like to think that Im nqt But I do believe it is incontestable that if that wind off the Rockies could be done away with the Two would be a hundred percent more comfortable place of the world The Two I have been sayingo I ought to clarify that to us the term meant both the landscape to all the horizons aroundthat is pretty much what a Montanan means by a countryand the national forest that my fathers district was part of In those days the six hundred square miles of the Two Medicine National Forest were divvied into only three ranger districts 0 English Greek Indian Head west of Choteau0 And Blacktail Gulch down by Sun River at the south end of the forest Actually only my fathers northmost portion of the Two Medicine National Forest had anything at all to do with the Two Medicine River or Two Medicine Lake the vicinity where the forest joins onto the south boundary of Glacier National Park and fits in there as a map shows it like a long straightsided peninsulabetween the park and the Continental Divide and the Blackfeet Indian Reservatiqn So the Two Medicine itself the river thatis honestly is in sight to hardly any of the Two countJyo Like all 31 the major flows of this region the river has its source up in the Rockies but then promptly cuts a sizable canyon east through the plains as it pushes to meet the Marias River and eventually the Burrows its way through the prairie you might almost say It is just the ring of the words Two Medicine that has carried the name all the way south along the mountains some thirty miles to our English Creek area The derivation as Ive heard it isthat in distant times the Blackfeet made their medicine lodgetheir place for sacred ceremonytwo years in a row near the high lake that is one of the rivers sources and the name lasted from thato By whatever way Two Medicine came to be it is an interesting piece of language I have always thoughto My father was waiting at another rutty off shoot from the North Fork road This one had so many cuts of track some of them dating from the era of wagon wheels that it looked like a kind of huge braid across the grasslan4so My father turned his gaze from the twined ruts to me and asked Everything under control at Walters Uh huh I affirmedo All right His businesslike expression had declined into what I think is called dolqr Lets go do ito And we set off into the weave of tracks around theHebner placeo No matter what time of day you approached it the Hebner place looked as if demolition wasbeing done and the demolishers were just now taking a smoke break An armada of abandoned wagons and car chassis and decrepit farm equipmenteven though Good Help Hebner farmed not so 32 much as a vegetable gardenlay around and between the brown old buildings A root cellar was caved in a tool shop had only half a roof left the barn looked distinctly teetery In short not much ever functioned on the Hebner place except gravity Out front of the barn now as we rode in stood a resignedlooking littler bay mare with two The pair onthe horse must have been Roy and Will or possibly Will and Enoch or maybeeven Enoch and Curtiso Sq frequent a bunch were they there was no keeping track of which size Hebner boy was who unless you were around them every dqy I takethat Even seeing them on a constant basis wouldnt necessarily have been a foolproof guide to who was who because all the faces in that Hebner family rhymed I dont know how else to put ito EveryHebner forehead was a copy of Good Helps wide crimpedinthemiddle version a pale bony expanse centered with a kind of tiny gully which widened asit went down as if the nose had avalanched out of thereo hank Across most of the left side of this divided forehead a of hair floppedat a crooked angleo The effect was as if every male Hebner wore one of those eye patches shown in pictures of pirates only pushed up highero from that forehead any Hebner face simply sort of dwindled down a quick skid of nose and a tight mouth and a small ball of chino The tandem horsebackersstared us thelength of the yardo It was another Hebnerquality to gawp at you as if you were some new species on eartho My father had a not entirely ironic theory to explain that Theyve all eaten so goddamn much venison their eyes have grown big as 33 deero For it was a fact of life that somewhere up there in the jackpinesbeyond the Hebner buildings would be a woolsack hanging from a top linibo The bottom of the sack would rest in a washtub of water and within the sack being cooled nicely by the moisture as it went wicking up through the burlap would be a hind quarter or two of venisono GoodHelp Hebner liked his deer the same way he preferred his Onthe face of the law one goodsearch through those jackpines should have clapped Good Help behind barso Yet that search never was made either by my father or by the game warden Joe Relliso For if Good Helps use of the Two forest as a larder was a known outcome the question part of the equation was where the next square meal for the Hebner kids would come from if Good Help was shut away for his deer Actually I dont mind Good Help snitching a deer every so often11 my father put it or even that hes so damn lazy he can barely breathe But when hestarts in on that goddamn oughtobiography of hishow he ought to have been this ought to have done that Morning Ranger Hello there Jick I dont know about my father but thatoutofnowhere gust of words startled me just a littleo The greeting hadnt issued from the staring boys on the marebut from behind the screen door of the log house Ought to have been paying attentionto the world so Id seen you coming and got some Thanks anyway Garland said my father who had heard years of 34 Good Help Hebner protocol and never yet seen a cup of coffee out of any of it Were just dropping off some baking Beth came out long qn Well do what we can to put it to good Commotion in front of the barn interrupted the voice of Good Heip The front boy atop the old horse was whacking her alongside the neck with the reins while the boy behind him was kicking the mount heartily in the ribs and piping Giddyup goddamn you horse giddyup Giddyup hell Good Helps yell exploded across the yardo It was always said of him that Good Help could talk at a volume which would blow a crowbar out of your hando The pair of you giddyoff and giddy over to that goshdamn woodpile We all watched for the effect of this on the two wouldbe jockeys and whenthere was none except increased exertion on the dilapidated mare51 Good Help addressed my father through the screen door again Ought to have taken that pair out and drowned them with the last batch of kittens way they behaveo I dont know whats got into kids any more With the profundity of that Good Help materialized from behind the screening and out onto the decaying railroad tie which served as the frontstep to the Hebner houeo Like his place Good Help Hebner himself was more than a little ramshackleo A tall yet potbellied man with one bib of his overalls usually frayed loose and dangling his sloping face madeeven more paleby a chevron of grizzle which mysteriously never matured into a real mustacbeo Garland Hebner nicknamed Good Help ever since the time years back when he volunteered to join the Noon Creek cattlemen whenthey branded their calves and thereby get in on a 35 free supper afterwardo In Dill Egans corral the branding crew at one point looked up to see Hebner for no reason that ever became clear hoisting himself onto Dills skittish irongray Almost before Hebner was truly aboard the gray slung him off and then tried to pound him apart while everybody else bailed out of the corral Hebner proved to be a moving target time and againthe hooves of the horse missed the rolling ball of man until finally Dill managed to reach in grab hold of a Hebner ankle and snake him out under the corral Hebner wobbled up blinked around at the crowd then sent his gaze on to the sky and declared as if piety was natural to him Well I had some Good Help getting out of that didnt I Some extra stickum was added to the nickname of by the fact that Good Help had never been found to be of any use whatsoever on any task anybody had been able to think up for himo He has a pernicious case of the slows Dode Withrow reported after he once made the error of hiring GoodHelp for a few days of fencing Ranger I beenmeaning to ask if it mightnt be possible to cut a few poles to fix that corral up with Good Help was blaring nowo The Hebner corral looked as if a buffalo stampede had passed through it and translated out of Hebnerese Good Helps question was whether he could help himself to some national forest pine without paying for tt Ought to have got at it before now but my back His allergy to work was the one characteristic in which the rest of the family did not emulateGood Heip They didnt Survival depended on whatever wages the squadron of Hebner kids could earn by 36 hiring out at lambing time or through haying season Up and down English Creek at those times of year on almost any ranchyou would find a Hebner boy bucketing water in the lambing shed or driving a stacker team in the hayfield a Hebner girl kitchenchoring for the ranch wieo Then at some point in their late teens each Hebner youngster somehow would come up with a more serious job and use it as an escape ladderout of that family Theoldest boys Harvey and Sanford and the daughterjust younger than them Norena already were out in theworld one place or I have toldthat among my thinking routes now is that question of whether Id be much the same person if my lineage and birthsite had been altered a bito Whenever I was around the Hebners a variation of that always shot to mind as it did now while Good Help nattered to my father about his intentions of repair Christamighty what if I had ttUilbled into life as a member of this family instead of my own For Alec and I hadaccidentallybeen on hand for one of the Hebner chapters of life the launching of Sanford and if I wished to mull matters of chance and circumstance that instancestood as a considerable education Itoccurred a couple of springs before when Ed Van Bebber came by the rangerstation one Friday night andasked if Alec and I could help out with the lambing chores that weekendo Neither of us much wanted to do it because EdVen Bebber is nobody favorite person except Ed Van Bebberso But you cant turn down a person whos in a pinch When the pair of us rode into Eds place earlythe next morningwe saw that Sanford Hebner was driving the gutwagon eventhough he was only seventeen or 37 so not all that much older than Alec at the time And that particular lambing season at Van Bebbers had been a rugged one the hay was used up getting through the winter and the ewes now thin as shadows and not particularly ready to become Ed had thrown the drop band clear up onto the south side of Wolf Butte to provide any grass for them at all which meant a mile and a half drive for Sanford to the ing shed with each gutwagon load of ewes and their fresh lambs With the ewes dropping eighty and ninety lambs a day out there Sanford was working every horse onthe ranch saddle horses and everything to pull that heavy wagon on that slope and make those long shed trips walking in to the ranch as many as three times a day to trade a playedout team for fresher horses All in all Sanford was performing about two mens work and doing it damn weil The day this happened dark had almost fallen Alec and I were up on the hillside above the lambing shed helping Ed Van Bebber corral a bunch of mother ewes and their weekold lambs and we meanwhile could see Sanford driving in with his last load of lambs of the We actually hadourbunch under control just fine the three of us and a dog or two But Ed always had to have a tendency toward So he cupped his hands to his mouth and yelled down the hillto Sanford HEYTHEREYOUHEBNER COMEUPHEREANDHELPUSCORRALTHESEEWESANDLAMBS I still think if Ed had asked properly Sanford probably would have been fool enough to have climbed upand joined us eventhough he already had put in his workday and But after the season of mans labor he had done to be yelled at to come up and help a couple of 38 milktooth kids like us chase lambs worse than that to not be awarded even his first name just be shouted to the world as a Hebner still can see Sanford perched on the seat of that gutwagon looking up the slope to us and then cupping his hands to his mouth the same way Ed had and hear yet his words carry up the hill YOUGOPLUMBTOHELLYOUOLDSONOFABITCH And he slapped his reins on the rumpsof the gutwagon team and drove on to the lambing shed At the supper table that night Sanfords check was in his plateo Sanford and that money though did not travel back up the North this Fork Hebner householdo When Alec and I headed home that night Sanford rode double behindme didnt think of it at the time but that must have been one more mortification straddling a saddle behind a shavetail kid like me after hed been a fullfledgedgutwagon driver all springand when we dismounted at the ranger station Sanford trudged into the dark straight downthe English Creek road asking at every ranch on the way whether a job of any sort could be had Anything Ill clean the chicken house The Busby brothers happened to need a bunch herder and Sanford had been with them ever since this very moment was herding one of their bands of sheep up in the mountains of the Twoa To me the realization of Sanfords situation that evening when Ed Van Bebber canned him knocking at any door rather than return home having a family a father that he would even clean chicken houses to be free of to me the news that life could deal such a hell of a situation to someone about the age of Alec and me came as a sobering 39 Missus Having failed to cajole my father out of free timber Good Help evidently had decided to settle for the manna wed come to delivera Got SOTIething out here The screen door opened and closed again producing Florene Hebner and leaving a couple of the very littlest HebnersGarlena and Jonas Jonas and Maybellagawping behind the mesh Since the baked goods were tied in a dish towel on my saddle I did the courteous thing and got off and took the bundle up to Florenea Florene was or had been a fairly goodlooking woman particularly among a family population minted with the face of Good Help But what was most immediately noticeable about her was how worn she looked As if shed been sanded down repeatedly Youd never have guessed the fact by comparingthe two but Florene and my mother went through grade school at Noon Creek together Florene though never made it beyond the second year of high school in Gros Ventre because she already had met Garland Hebner and promptly was pregnant by him and a little less promptly on Garlands part was married to hLm She gave a small downcast smile as I handed her the bundle said to meThank your ma again Jick and retreated back insiqe Funny to see Alec not with you Good Help was declaiming to my fatheras I returned fromthe doorway to Ponyo But they do grow and go So they do my father agreed without enthusiasm Garland we got sheep waiting forus up the mountaLna You ready Jick My father touchedMouse into motion thenuttered to Good Help in parting purely pokeifaced Take it easy 40 The route we rodeout of the Hebner place was a sort of down L the long climbing stem of ruts and then the brief northwestward leg of the North Fork trail where it tops onto the English CreekNoon Creek dividea Coming onto that crest we now would be in view of the landmarksthat are the familiar sentries of the Two country Chief Mountaineventhough it is a full seventy miles to the north and almost into Canada standing distinct as a mooring peg at the end of the long chain of mountains Also north but nearer Heart Butteno great piece of geography yet it too poses separate encugh from the mountain horizon that its dark pyramid form can be constantly seen and identified And just to our east the full timbertopped profile of Breed Butte a junior landmark but plainly enough the summit of our English Creek areaa With all this offered into sight I nonetheless kept my eyes on my father watching for what I knew would heppen what always happened after he paid a visit to the Hebner There at the top of the rise he halted his horse and instead of giving his regard to the distant wonders of Chief Mountain and Heart Butte he turned for a last slow lookat the Hebner hodgepodge Then shook his head said Jesus Ha Christ and reined awqy For in that woebegone log house downthere and amidthose buildingsbefore neglect had done its handiwork on them my father was born and brought Of course then the place was the McCaskill homestead And the North Fork known by the nickname of Scotch Heaven on account of the several ourronthetongueandthistleupthekilt families who had come 41 over and settled Duffs Barclays Frews Findlaters Erskines and my McCaskill grandparents they lit in here sometime in the 1880s and all were dead or defeated or departed by the time the flu epidemic of 1918 and the winter of 19 got done with them I possessed no firsthand information on my fathers parents Both of them were under the North Fork soil by the time I was And despite my fathers ear to the past there did not seem to be anything known or at least fit to report about what the McCaskills came from in Scotlando Except for a single scrap of lore the story that a McCaskill had been one of the of Arbroath who worked for the Stevensonsas I savvy it the Stevensons must have been a family of engineers before Robert Louis cropped into the lineage and picked up a penwhen they were putting the lighthouses all around the coast of Scotlando The thought that an ancestor of ours helped fight the sea with stone meant more to my father than he liked to let on As far as I know the only halfway sizable body of water my father himself had ever seen was Flathead Lake right here in Montana let alone an ocean and its beacons Yet when the fire lookout towers he had fought for were finally being built on the Two Medicine forest during these years it was noticeable that he called them FranklinDelanos lighthouses Looking back from now at that matter of my McCaskill grandparents I question frankly whether my mother and father would or could have kept close with that side of the family even if it had still been extant No marriage is strong enough to bear two loads of inlaws Early on the choice might as well be made that one family will be seen as much as 42 can be stood and the other probably the husbands shunted off to rare visits Thats theory of coure But theory and my mother in any case all I grew up knowing of the McCaskills of Scotch Heaven was thirty years of homestead effort proved to be the extent of their lifetimes and that my father emerged from the homestead for good in the war year of 1917 Yeah I went off to Wilsons war Fought in blood up to my knees As I have told the one crack in how solemn my father could be in announcing something like this was that lowered left eyelid of his and I liked to watch for it to dip down and introduce this next part Fact is you could get yourself a f ight just about any time of day or night in those saloons outside Fort Leonard Wood That my fathers combat had been limited to fists against Missouri chins seemed not to bother him a whit although I myself wished he had some tales of the actual war Rather I wished his knack with a story could have illuminated that warexperience of his generation as an alternative to so many guys plain refrain that Godcanhavethewholebedamnedplaceo But you settle for what family lore you can My fathers history resumes that when he came back from conducting the war against the Missourian saloonhounds he was hired on by the Noon Creek cattle ranchers as their association ridero Generally some older hand got the job but I was single and broke just the kind ranchers love to whittle their wages down to fit by then too the wartime livestock prices were on their toboggan ride downand they 43 took me onQ That association job of course was only a sUmmer one the combined Noon Creek cattleexcept those of the big Double W ranchtrailing up onto the national forest grass in June and down out again in September and so in winters my father fed hay at one cow ranch or another and then when spring came and brought lambing time with it he would hire on with one of theEnglish Creek sheepmen I suppose that runs against the usual notion of the West of cow chousers and mutton conductors forever at odds with each othero But anybody who grew up around stock in our part of Montana knew no qualm about working with either cattle and sheep Range wars simply neverwere much the Montana style and most particularly not the Two Medicine fashion Oh somewhere in history there had been an early ruckus south toward the Sun River some cowman kiyiing over to try kill off a neighboring band of sheep And probably in any town along these mountains Browning or Gros Ventre or Choteau or Augusta you could go into a bar and still find an occasional old hammerhead who proclaimed himself nothing but a cowboy and never capable of drawing breath as anything else especially not as a mutton puncher Which isnt to say that most sheepherders werent equally irreversibly sheepherders but somehow that point never seemed to need constant general announcement as it did with cowboyso By and large though the Montana philosophy of makedoas practiced by our sizable ranching proportion of Scotchmen Germans Norwegians and Missourians meant that ranch people simply tried to figure out which species did best at the moment sheep or cows and chose accordingly It all came 44 down so far as I could see to the philosophy my father expressed whenever someoneasked himhow he was doing Just trying to stay level In that time when young Varick McCaskill became their association rider there still would have been several Noon guys ccws getting along nicely on a hundred or so head Now nearlyall of those places either were bought up by Wendell Williamsons Double W or under lease to it The Williamsons of life always do try to latch onto all the land that touches theirs was my fathers view on that What I am aiming at though isthat among those Noon Creek stockmen when my father was hired on was Isaac Reese mostly a horse raiserbutunder the inspiration of wartime prices also running cattle just It was when my father rode in to pick up thoseReese cattle for the drive into the mountainsthat he first saw my mother Saw her as a woman that is Oh I had knownshe had some promise Lisabeth Reese The name alone madeyou keep her somewhere in mindo Longrange opportunities seemed to elude my father but he could be nimble enough in the short run I wasnt without some practice at girlingo AndBeth was worth some extra effort The McCaskillReese matrimony ensued and a year or so after that Alec Which then meant that my father and mother were supporting themselves and a youngster by a job that my father had been given because he was single and didnt needmuch wage This is the brand of situation you can find yourself in without much effort in Montana but that it is connnon does not make it one damn bit more acceptable I am sure as anything that the memory of that predicament at the start of my parents 45 married life lay large behind their qualms about what Alec now was intending My father especially wanted no repeat in any son of his of that season by season scrabble for livelihoodo I know our family ruckus was more complicated than just that Anything ever is But if amid the previous evenings contention my father and Alec could have been put under oath each Bibled to the deepest of the truths in him my fatherwould have had to say something like I dont want you making my mistakes over again And Alec to him Your mistakes were yours theyve got nothing to do with rneo My brother and my father I am hard putto know how to describe them as they seemed to me then in that time when I was looking up at them from fourteen years of age How to lay each onto paper for a map is never the country itself only some ink suggesting the way to get Which may be why the calendar of their lives the seasons of the Two Medicine country somehow seems to bring out more about this pair than sketchwork does Yes I believe that to come close to any understanding of Alec McCaskill or Varick McCaskill you would have had togone through ayear at the side of eaGh Of course until Alec graduated that May the year as he and I knewit always had that long 9month compartment in it the school year two The first grades Alec went to a country school out west of Choteau the Indian Head ranger station down there at the middle of the Two Medicine National Forest was where my father started in the Forest 46 Service Myself I have only a fewbeginning recollections of the four or so years we spent at Indian Head A windstorm one night that we thought was going to take the roof off the ranger station A time Alec and I rode double into the mountains with our father for he took us along on little chore trips as soon as we were big enough to perch on a horea Funny what memory does That a day of straddling behind the saddle where my brother satmy nose inches from the collar of Alecs jacket and I can tell you as well as anything that the jacket was green corduroy Alec a greener green than the forest around usis so alive even yet Anyway after Indian Head came our move to English Creek and my fathers rangering of the north end of the Two ever since Now that I think on all this that onset of our third school year for I recall how damn irked I wasthat new home or not here Alec was again riding off to school every morning while I still had a whole year to wait Next year did come and there we both were going to school to Miss Thorkelson at the South Fork schoolhouse along with the children of the ranch families on the upper end of English Creekthe Hahn boys a number of Busbys and Roziers the Finletter twins the Withrow girls and then of course the Hebner kids who made up about half the school by themselvesa Alec always stood well in hisstudiesa Yet I cant help but believe the SouthFork school didme more good than it did him You know how those oneroom schools are all eight grades there in one clump for the teacher to have to handle By a fluke of Hebner reproductive history 47 Marcella Withrow and I were the only ones our age at South Fork so as a class totaling two we didnt take up much of Miss Thorkelsons lesson time and she always let us read extra or just sit and partake of what she was doing with the older gradeso By the time Marcella and I reached the 6th gradewe already had listened through the older kids geography and reading and history and grammar five times I still know what the capital of Bulgaria is and not too many people I meet doo And since Miss Thorkelson was a bearcat on poetry parts of poems lodged in the mind then too The holiest of all holidays are those keptby ourselves in silence and apartoThe secret anniversaries of the heart As did thebooks she would read to us from at the last of each school day Squire Trelawney Doctor Livesey and the rest of these gentlemen havin asked me to write down the whole articulars about Treasure Island from the beginning to the end keeping nothing back but the ings of the island and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted I take up my pen Ill tell you right now that Treasure rsland isstill one topnotch book Anyway words I always could remember like nobodys business Numbers less Oo But there Alec shined Shined in spite of himself if such is possible It surprised the hell out of all of us in the family I can tell youthe exact night wegot this new view of Alec It had been paper dayfor my father the one he set aside each month to wrestle paperwork asked for by the Two Medicine National Forest headquarters down in Great Falls and more than likely another batch 48 wanted by the Region One office over in Missoula as well The author of his sorrow this particular time was Missoula which had directed him to prepare and f orwardthat was the way Forest Service off ices talkeda report on the average acreageof all present and potential grazing allotments in his English Creek ranger district Potential was the nettle in this for it meant that my father had to dope out from his maps every bit of terrain which fit the grazing regulations of the time and translate those map splotches into acreage So acres had been in the air all that day in our household and it was at supper that Alec asked how many acres there were in the Two Medicine National Forest al together a Alec was twelve at the time Which would have made me eight since there were four years between us Three years and 49 weeks I preferred to count it my birthday beirg on Septenier 4th and Alecs the 25th of that srure month But the point here is that we were both dcwn there in the grade school years am my father didnt particularly care to be carrying on a conversation about any more acreage so he just answered Quite a bunch I dont know the figureexactya Alec was never easy to swerve Well how many sections does it have You likely know that a section is a square mile in the survey system used in this country Prettyclose to 60011 my father knew offhaid Then thats 384000 acres imparted Alec That sounds high to me my father responded going on with 49 his meal Better get a pencil and paper and work it OtJt Alecshook his head against the pencil and paper notion 384000 he said agaLn Bet you a milkshake At this juncture my mother was heard from Therell be no betting at thesupper table young mqn But she then got up and went to the put sideboard where the mail was and returned with an envelopea On the back of it she did the pencil work600 times 640 the number of acres in a sectionand in a moment reported 3840QOo Are you sure my father asked o My mother in her younger days had done a little schoolteaching so here my father simply was getting deeper into the aritlnnetic bqg Do you want to owe both Alec and me milkshakes she challenged him back No I can do without that my father saLd He turned to Alec again andstudied him a bit Then All right Mister Smart GtJYo Howmuch is 365 times 12 This too took Alec only an instalto 4380 he declaredo Why Whats that Its about how many days a twelveyearold like you has been on this earth my father saido Whichis to say its about how long its taken us to discover what it is youve got in that head of yours That then was what might be called the school year portion of Alec Anability he couldnt really account forI dont know Jicker I just can was allthe answer I could everget when I pestered him about how he could handle figures in his head like thatand maybe 50 didnt absolutely want or at least welcomeo The Alec of sunnner was another matter entireiy What he didnt display the happy knack of in terms of ranch or forest workthat went on in the Two country at that season of year hadnt yetbeen inventedo Fixing fence figuring correrpost s how to splice in barbwire and set Alec was a genius at any time an English Creek rancher got money enough ahead for fence work herehe came toask Alec to ride his lines and fix where neededo When Alec at age thirteen came to his first haying season and was to drivethescatter rake for our unclePete Reese after the first few r or a while1 regular windrow rakin8insteada As a scatter days Pete put him was raker Alec job for more than it was worth trotting his team of horses anywhere in the hayfield a stray scrap of hay might be found the regularity of making windrows Pete said slowed him down to within reasqno That same headlong skill poppedout whenever Alec set foot into the mountains On our counting trips before this year he per redaiailedi petually was the first to see deer or elk or a hawk or whatever before I did and oftenbefore our father did The combination of all this in Alec I am sure as anything was what inspired my father and mother to champion college and engineeringo They never put it in so bald a way but Alecs mathematical side and his knacky nature and his general gotoit approach seemed to them fitted for an engineera A builder a doer Maybe even an engineer for the Forest Serviceitself for in those New Deal times there were projects under way everywhere a place couldbe found for them it seemed like The idea even rang right with Alec at firto Allthrough that 51 winter of his last year in high school Alec kept sayinghe wished he could go right now go to the college at Bozeman and get started But then Leona happened and the Double W summer job again and the supper ruckus about marriage over college Well that was a years worth of Alec so to speak His partner in ruckus my father up there on the horse in front of me cant be calendared in the strictly regular fashion either Despite the order of months printed and hung on our wall at the English Creek ranger station a Varick McCaskill year began with autumno With Indian summer actually which in our part of Montana arrives after a mary stormy turn of weather around Labor Dayo Of course every ranger is supposed to inspect the conditions of his forest there at the end of the grazing season My father all but Xrayed his portion of the Two Medicine National Foreta South Fork and North Fork up under the reefs in beyond Heart Butte day after day he delved the Two almost as if makingsure to himself that he still had all of that zone of geography And somehowwhen the bands of sheep trailed down and streamed toward the railroad chutes at Blackfoot or Pendroy he was on hand there too to look themover gossip with the herders the ranchers the lamb buyers join in the jackpot bets about howmuch the lambs would weigh It was the time of year when he could assess his job see right there on the land and on the hoof the results of his rangering and give thought to how to adjust it A necessary inventoryseason autumno Henever wintered wei1 Came down with colds sieges of hacking and sniffling like someone you would think was a permanent pneumonia 52 candidate Strange for a man of hislengthy strength and otherwise so in tune with the Two country Are you sure you were born and raised up there on the North Fork my mother would ask along with about the third mustard plaEter she applied onto him every wintero Maybe a traveling circus left you More than likely all of my fathers winter ailments really were symptoms of just one indoorneSo For stepping out a door somehow seemed to extend him actually tip his head higher and brace his shoulders straighter and the farther he went from a house the more he looked like he knew what he was doing Does that sound harsh Its not meant to All I am trying to work into words here is that my father was a man born to the land in an Oliver a job that sometimes harnessed him to a a book of regulationso A man caught between in a number of ways I have since come to see that he was of a generation that this particularly happens too The ones who are firstborn in a new land My belief is that it will bethe same when there are births out on the moon or the other planets Those firstborn always always will live in a straddle between the ancestral path of life and the route of the new lando In my fathers case the old country of the McCaskills Scotland was as distant and blank as theNorth Pole and the fresh one America still was making itself o Especially a roughedged part of America such as the Montana he was born into and grew up in All my fathers sessions with old Toussaint Rennie hearing whateverhe could about the past days of the Two Medicine country I think were due to this to a need for some 53 footing some groundwork of the time and placehe found himself in The Forest Service itself was an inbetween thing for that matter Keeper of the national forests their timber grass water yet merchant of those resources too Anybody local like my father who turned green by joining the USFS now sided against thethinking of a lot of people he had known all his life people whoconsidered that the country should be wide 0pen orat least wider open than it was for using Andeven within all this ranger Varick McCaskill was of a betwixt varietyo A good many of the guys more veteran than my father dated back to the early time of the Forest Service maybe even to when it was established in 1905 they tendedto be reformed cowboys or loggers orsomesuch old hands who had been wrestling the West since before my father was borno Meanwhilethe men younger than my father were showing up with college degrees in forestry and the New Deal alphabet on their tongues So there my father was between and between and between My notion in all thisis that winter that season of house time and waiting simply was one more betweenthanhecouldstando When spring let himout and around my father seemed to green up with the countryo In the Two even spring travels in on the chinooks which can cause you to lean into them like a drunk against a lamppost while theymelt away the snowbanks of wintero The first roar of a chinook beginning to sweep downoff the top of the Rockies signaled newness promise to my father The wind from Eden he called the chinook forhe must have read that Paperwork chores he 54 hadput off and off now got tackled and disposed of He and his assistant ranger gave the gear of the English Creek ranger district a goingover saddles bridles pack saddles fire equipment phone lines all of ito With his dispatcher he planned the work of trail crews and the projects the Civilian Conservation Corps boys would be put to and the deployment of fire guards and smokechasers when the fire seasonheated up And from the first moment that charitably might be classified as spring my father read the mountains Watched the snow hem along the peaks judging how fast the drifts were melting Cast a glance to English Creek various times of each day to see how high it was running Kept mental tally of the wildlife when the deer started back up into the mountains whenthe fur of the weasel turned from white to brown how soon the first pile of coalblack droppings in the middle of a trail showed that bears were out of hibernation To my father and through him to the rest of us in the family the mountains nowwere their own calendar you might And finally springs offspring Summer The high season the one the rest of my fathers ranger year led up to Summer was going to tell itself for my father and I were embarking into it now with this counting trip a gander Dont you think My father had halted Mouse and was swiveled around lookingat me in curiosity Sometimes Ithink if I endure in life longenough to get senile nobody will be able to tell the difference given how my mind 55 has always drifted Uh come again Imusteredo I didnt quite catch that Anybody home there under your hat I was saying its about time you checked on your packslinging Better hop off and take a gander Back there on the subject of our horses I should have told too that we were leading one pack horse with us Tomorrow after we finished the counting of the Kyle and Hahn bandsof sheep we were going on up to Billygoat Peak where Paul Eliason the junior forester who was my trail men fathers assistant ranger and a couple building a fire lookout They had gone in the previous week with the precut framework and by now likely had the lookout erected and shingled but the guywire had been late in coming from Missoula That wasour packload now the roll of galvanized cable and some bolts and You may think the wind blows in the lower areas of the Two but up there on top it really huffs Thisthird horse bearer of the load whose ropes and hitch knots I now was testing for tautness was an elderly solemn sorrel whom my father addressed as Brownie but the rest of us called by the name hed been givenbefore the Forest Service deposited him at the English Creek station Homer Having Brownie Homer along was cause for mixed emotions One more horse is always a nuisance to contend with yet the presence of a pack animal also made a journey seem more substantial testified that you werent just jaunting off to somewhere you were transporting Packstrings of horses and mules had beenthe lifeblood 56 of the Forest Service ever since its birth the hoofed carriers of supply into the mountains of all the west I know for a fact that my father considered that the person most important to his job as English Creek district ranger was not Paul Eliason although Paul was a good enough assistant nor anyone up the hierarchy the superintendent of the Two Medicine National Forest or the regional forester of Region One or any of those but his packer Isidor Pronovost Since the lookout gear and our food only amounted to a load for one horse it hadnt been necessary to call on Isidor for this counting trip of ours Butevenabsent he had his influence that morning as I arranged the packs on BrownieHomer under my fathers scrutiny both of us total converts to Isidors perpetual preachment that in packing a horse or a mule balance iseverything One of the best things that was ever said to me was Isidors opinion that I was getting to be a pretty daggone good cargodier in learning how to fit cargo onto a pack animal These particular Billy Peak packs took me some extra contriving to make a roll of heavy guywire on one side of the pack saddle equivalent to some canned goods on the other side of it but finally my father had proclaimed There looks to me like you got it Isidored Evidently I had indeed for I didnt find that the packs or ropes had shifted appreciably on our ride thus far But I went ahead and reefeddown on a rope or two anyway them even further to justify the report to my father All tight as fiddlestrings While I was crossexamining the pack ropes my father had been looking out over the country all aroum Ronan Reef predominated above us of course But just across the gorge of the North Fork 57 from it anotrer Jandrrark Rooster Mountain was startirg to stand over us too Its broad open face of slope was topped with an abrupt upshoot of rock like a roosters conb which gave it the name Since we re this far aloq my father decided maybe we might as well eat sone lWlch11 The view rather than his stormch guided him in that choice I believe By late morning we were so well started into tre mountains above the English CreekNoon Creek divide that we could see down onto both drainages and their various ranches and on out to where the farm patterns began east of the town of Gros Ventre To be precise on a map our lunch spot was about wherethe eastpointing panhandle of the TwoMedicine National Forest joins onto the panthe pan being the seventy ive mile extent of the forest along the front of the Rockies from East Glacier at the north to Sun River at the south Somehow when theforest boundary was drawn the English Creek corridor the panhandle route we had just ridden got included and that is why our English Creek ranger station was situated out there with ranches on three sides of ito That location like a nest at the end of a limb bothered some of the map gazers at Region One eadquarteiso Theyd have denied it but they seemed to hold the theory that the deeper a ranger station was buried into preposterous terrain the better Another strike was that English Creek sat nearly at the southern end of my fathers district central or tidy about the location either But the Mazoola inmates had never figuredout anything to do about English Creek and while the valleybottom site added some riding miles to my fathers job the convenience of being amid the English Creek ranch f amilieshis constituents so to speakwas more than worth ito My mother had put up sandwiches for us slices of fried ham 58 between slabs of homemade bread daubed wit4 fresh yellow You cant beat that combinationo Eating those sandwiches and gazing out over the Two country mended our dispositions a lot If a person can take time to reflect on such a reach of land other matters will dim An area the size of the Two is like a small natiqn Big enough to have several geographies and an assortment of climates and an appreciable population yet compact enough that people know each other from one end of the Two to the A hawk went by below us sailing on an air current A mark of into the mountains I always watched for hawks and even eagles now on routes lower than our own Mostly however as my father and I worked our way through wiches and a shared can of plums I simply tried to store away the look of the land this lush Juneo Who knew if it would ever be this green again The experience of recent years sure as hell didnt suggest so For rightout there in that green 0 farmland and prairie where my father and Iwere gazing a part of the history of the Depression began to brew on a day of early May in 1934 Nobody here in the Two could have identified it as more than an ordinary wind Stiff but thatis never news in the Two country As that wind continued east however it met a weather front angling down out of Canada and the combined velocity set to work on the plowed fields along the High Line An open winter and a spring of almost no rain had left those fields dry brown talcum waiting to be Andso a cloud of wind and topsoil wasborn and Bythe timethe dirt storm reached 59 Plentywoodin the northeastern corner of the state the grit of it was scouring paint off All across the Dakotas further dry fields were waiting to become dusto The brown storm rolled into the Twin Cities and on to Chicago whereit shut down plane flights and caused lights to be turned on in the middle of the day I dont understand the science of it but that storm continued to grow and widen and darken the more it traveled Montana dirt and Dakota dirt and Minnesota dirt in the skies and eyes of Illinois Indiana Ohio And on and on the storm swept intoNew York City and Washington the dust of the west foggingout the pinnacle of the Empire State building and powdering the shiny table tops within the White Houseo At last the dirt cloud ex pended itself into the Atlantico Of course thereafter came years of dust particularly in the Great Plains and the Southwesto But that Montanaborn blow was the Depressions first nightmarestorm the one that told the nation that matterswere worsethan anyone knew the soil itself was fraying loose and flying away In a way wherever I scrutinized from the lunch perch of that day I was peering down into some local neighborhood of the Depression As if say a spyglass such as Walter Kyles could be adapted to pick out items through time instead of distance The farmers of all those fields hennning the eastern horizon Theywere veterans of years of scrabbling Prices and crops both had been so weak for so long many a farm family got by only on egg money or cream Or any damn thing they could come up witho Time upon timewe were called on at the ranger station by oneoveralled farmer or another from near Gros Ventre or Valier or 60 even Conrad traveling from house to house offering a dressed hog he had in the trunk of his jalopy for three cents a pound Believe it or not though those farmers of the Two country were better off than the ones who neighbored them on the east That great dust storm followed a path across northern Montana already blazed by drought grasshoppers army worms you name it Around the time the CCC the Civilian Conservation Corps was being set up my father and other rangers and county agents and maybe government men of other kinds were called to a session over at Plentywoqd It was the idea of some government thinkerthe hunch was that it came down all the way from Tugwell or one of thosethat everybody working along any lines of conservation ought to see Montanas worsthit area of droughto My father grumbled about it costing him three or four days of work from the Two but he had no choice but to goo I especially remember this because when he got back he said scarcely anything for about a day and a half and that was not at all like him Then atsupper the second night he suddenly looked across at my mother and burst out Bet therere people over there whore trying to live on just potatoeso They feed Russian thistles to their stock Call it Hoover hqy It1 just never saw such things Never even dreamedof them Fencelines pulled loose by the wind piling tumblewoods against them When a guy goes to drive crowbar a fencepost he first has topunch holes in the ground with and pour in water to soften the soil And out in the fields what the dust doesnt cover the goddamn grasshoppers I tell you Bet its a crime against life whats happening 61 So that was the past that came to mind from the horizon of green farms nd closer below us along the willowed path of Noon Creek the Depression history of the cattlemen was no happier memory Noon Creek is the next drainage north of English Creek swale country without as much cottonwood and aspen alongitsstream banks Original cattle country the best cowgrazing land anywhere in the Two But what had been a series of about ten good ranches spaced along Noon Creek was dwindled to three Farthest west nearest our lunch perch the Reese family place now run by my mothers brother Pete who long ago converted to Just east from there Dill Egans cow outfit with its historic round corrql And everywhere east of Dill the miles of Double W swales and benchland and the eventual cluster of buildings that was the Double W home Dill Egan was one of those leery types who steered clear of banks and so had managedto hold his lando The Williamsons of the Double W a bank and property in San Francisco or Los Angeles one of those places and as my father put it When the end of the world comes the lastsound willbe a nickel falling from someplace a Williamson had it hid Every Noon Creek cowman between the extremes of Dill Egan andWendell Williamson though got wiped out when the nations plunge flattened the cattle market Places were foreclosed on families shatteredo The worst happened at a piece of Noon Creek I could not help but look down onto fromour lunch sitethe double bend of the stream an S of water and will6ws like a giant brand onto the Noon Creek The place there had belonged to a rancherwho on the day before foreclosure told his wife he had some things to do hed be a while in the barn 62 Where he tacked up in plain sighton one of the stalls an envelope on whichhe had written I cant take any more I wont have my ears knocked down by life any And then hung himself with a halter rope The name of the rancher was Carl Nansen and that Nansen land was bought up by the Double W Wendell Williamsonll let us have the house onthe Nansen place to live in had been Alecs words about the domestic plan after he and Leona became and Mrs this fall The thought of this and the sight of that creek S were as if wires had connected in me forsuddenly I wIlted to turn to my father and ask him everything about Aleco What my brother was getting himself into sashaying off into the Depression with a saddle and a bridle and a bridee Whether there was any least chance Alec could be headed off from boying or maybe fromLeona since the two somehow seemed to go together How my father and my mother were going to be able to reason in any way with him given last nights family explosion Where we stood as a family Divided for all time Or yet the unit of four we had always been Ask and ask and ask the impulse rose in me as if coming to percolation My father was onto his feet had pulled out his pocket watch and was kidding me that my stomach wasabout half an hour fast as usual it was only now noon and I got up too and went with him to our But still felt the asking everywhere in No I put that wrongo About the ask ask ako I did not want to put to my father those infinite questions about my brothero What I wanted in the way that a person sometimes feels hungry halfstarved 63 but doesnt know exactly what it is that hed like to eat was for my father to be answering them Volunteering saying I see how to bring Alec out of it or Itll pass give him a couple of weeks and hell cool off about Leona and then But Varick McCaskill wasnt being voluntary he was climbing onto his horse and readying to go be a ranger And to my own considerable surprise I let himo Why I kept my silence did not blurt out my accumulated asking as I would have done any other time before that moment is a puzzle I have thought about a lqto In a sense I have thought about it all the years since that June lunchtime above the Noon CreekEnglish Creek diviqeo My conclusion such as it is is that right then and there I became old enough tobe aware of two necessities at once And the one that I was choosing with silence was that my father and I needed this trail day therhythm or ritual or whatever it was of beginning a counting trip of again fitting ourselves to the groove of the task and the travel and the Of entering another Two summer together I might as well say All of this the other necessity the one involving the questions about Alec would unbalance We tellourselves whatever is needed to go from one scene of life to the Tonight in camp I told myself now there that would be early encugh to muster the asking Without full knowing it telling myself too that life was offering new considerations fairly often now Dode Withrows sheep were nowhere in evidence when we arrived at 64 the counting vee an hour or so afterour lunch stqpo A latestart by the herder might account for their absence or maybeit just was one of those mornings when sheep are pokeyo In either case I had learned from my father to expect delay because if you try to follow some exact time when you work with sheep you will rapidly drive yourself looriy I might as well go up over here and have a look at that winter kill my father decided A stand of pine about a mile to the north was showing the rusty color of deatho How about you hanging on here in case the sheep show up I wont be gone lortgo He forced a grlno Think about how to grow up saner than that brother of yours nThis whole familys sanity could stand some thinking about crossed my mind in reply but didnt come auto My father climbed on Mouse andwent to worry over winter kill on his forest I took out my jackknife and started putting my initials into the bare fallen log I was sitting qn This I did whenever I had time to pass in the forest of the Two and I suppose even yet up there some logs and stumps announce J McC to the silent univereo The wind finally had gone down I had no tug at my attention except for the jackknife in my harid Carving initials as elaborate as mine does take some concentratiqno The J never was too bad to make and the M big and easy but the curves of the esneeded to be carefully cuto Thanks to the tardy Withrow sheep I had ample leisure to do so I suppose sheep have caused more time to be whiled away than anyother creatures in the worid Evenyet on any number of Montana ridgelines 65 there can be seen stone cairns about the height of a Sheepherders monuments they are called and what they are monuments to is monotony Just to be doing something a herder would start piling stones but because he hated to admit he wasout there hefting rocks for no real reason hed stack up a shape that he could tell himself would serve as a landmark Fighting back somehow against loneliness That was a perpetual part of being a sheep herder In the wagons of a lot of them you would find a stack of old magazines creased and crumpled from being carried in a hip pocketo An occasional prosperous herder would have a battery radio to keep him company in the evenings Once in a while you cameacross a carver or a braider Quite a few though the ones who givetheherding profession a reputation for skewed behavior figured they couldnt be bothered with pasttimeso They just lived in their heads and that can get to be cramped quarterso Those religions which featureyears of solitude and silence I have grave doubts I believe you are better off doing anything rather than nothing Even if it is only piling stones or fashioning initials In anyevent that jackknifework absorbed me for I dont know how long but to the point where I was startled by the first blats of the Withrow sheep Iheaded on downthroughthe timber on foot to help bring them to the counting vee A sheepman could have the whole Seventh Cavalry pushing his band along and hed still glad of further helpo Dode Withrow spotted me and called Afternoon Jick That father of yourscome to his senses and turn his job over to you 66 Hes patrolling to a winter kiJlo Saidhed be back bythe time we get up to the vee At the rate these sonsabitches want to move along today hes got time to patrol the whole Rocky Mountains This was remarked loud enough by Dode that I figured it was not for my benefit alone Sure enough an answer shot out of the timber to our left You might just remember the sonsabitches ARE sheep instead of racehorses Into view over there between some trees came Dodes herder Pat Hoy For as long as I had been accompanying my father on counting trips and I imagine for years before Dode and Pat Hoy had been wrangling with each other as much as they wrangled their sheep How do Jick Dont get too close to Dode hes on the prod this morningo Wants the job done before it gets started Im told you cantell the liveliness of a herder by how his sheep moveDode suggested Maybe you better lay down Pat while we send for the undertaker If Im slow its because Imstarved down trying to live on the grub you furniho Jick Dode is finally gonna get out of the sheep busineSo Hes gonna set up a stinginess school for you Scotchrneno That set all three of us laughing as we pushed the band along for an anthem of the Two was Dode Withrows lament of staying on and on in the sheep busines Inthat t19 winter I remember coming in to the house and standing over thestove Id been out all day skinning frozetodeathsheep Standing there trying to thaw the goosebumps off 67 myself and saying This is it This does it I am going to get out of the sonofabitching sheep business Then in 32 whenthe price of lambswent down to 4 a pound and might just as well have gone all the way to nothing I told myself This is really it o No more of the sonofabitching sheep business for roeo Ive had it And yet here I am still in the sonofabitching sheep business God what a man puts himself througho That was Dode for yquo Poet laureate of the woes of sheep and a sheepman to the pith of his SOtJL On up the mountainslope he and Pat Hoy and I now shoved the It took a while because up is not a direction sheep particularly care to go at least at someone elses suggestiqno Sheep seem perpetually leery of whats over the hill which I suppose makes them either notably dumb or notably smart Myself I liked sheep Or rather I didnt mind sheep as such whichis the best a person can dotowards creatures whose wool begins in their brain and I liked the idea of sheepo True sheep had to be troubled with more than cattle did but the troubling was on a smaller scale Pulling a lamb from a ewes womb is nothing to untangling a leggy calf from the inside of a heifero And a sheep you can brand by dabbing a splot of paint on her back not needing to invite half the county in to maul your livestock around in thedust of a branding corral Twelve times out of a dozen in the debate of cow and ewe I will choose sheep For a person JB rtial to the id ea of sheep I was in the rig ht tine arrl place With the encouragenent of what the Depression had done 68 to cattle prices the Two Medicine country then was a kind of vast garden of wool and lamoso Beginning in late May for a month solid a band of sheep a day passed throughthetown of Gros Ventre on the way northto the Blackfeet Reservation band after band trailing from all the way down by Choteau and other sheep ranchers bringing theirs from arourrl Bynum and Pendroy Not without sorre cost to the civic tidiress of Gros Ventre for the passage of a band of a ewes and their lambs through a tavn cannot happen without evidence being left on the street and occasionally the sidewalks Sheep are nervous enough as it is and being routed through a canyon of buildiqs does not improve treir bathroom manners any Once Carnelia Muntz wife of the First Natioral banker shGJed up in tba bank and said sorre thing about all the sheep muss on the streets o I give Ed Van Bebber his full due Ed happened to be in there cashing a check am he looked her up and down arrl advised Dont think of them as sheep turds Carnelia Think of them as berries off the money tree This was a tirre on the Reservation when you could see a oorder s wagon on top of practically every rise a fleet 69 of white wagons anchored across the lando And off to the east just out of view beyond the bench ridges the big sheep outfits from over in Washington were running their tens of thousands tooo And of course in here to the west where we working Dode Withrows sheep to the counting vee my fathers forest pastured the English Creek bandso Sheep and their owners were the chorus in our lives at the English Creek ranger station the theme of every season and almost all conversatiqno Blindfold and tickle me and through it all I still could have identified each English Creek sheepman by voice and tale Preston Rozier who had the ranch just down the creek from the ranger statiOn originally his parents hadhomesteaded not far south of Pendroy and as in a lot of cases growing up on a homestead sharpened his eyes for any other way of The summer when a surveyor crew arrived to run the route for the railroad to push north from Bymnn to Pendroy they boarded with the Roziers Probably the best t crop our family ever did get off that home8fad was those surveyors When the railroad arrived in a few years it brought with it Press vision of his futureo Id see those cowmen come into Pendroy when they shipped their stock theyd be pretty sorry lookers cook over a campfire and sleep under their wagons and kind of slink off home the next dqy But sheepmen hell theyd arrive and ship their wool and then hang around and drink and whoop and raise general hell maybe party for three or four days before theyd drive off in a fancy car of some kind And a few later theyd be back to ship their lambs and do it all againo Right then I figured the money was in sheep 70 Ed Van Bebber with the first place up the South Fork Ed had a scarum way of going about things but nobody ever questioned his knack with sheepo During lambing for example Ed never even hired a night man just got up from the supper table and went out to take the shift himself There in the shed hed nap in his sheepskin coat until the cold woke him up then go around and collect the fresh drop of lambs Being his own night man gave him a lower payroll than anyone else on the al though nobody else figured the selfpunishment was worth itbut as little as Iever liked Ed I do believe he did his double duty for more than love of dollars Its just got to be done is all In lambing its the ewes and me against all the od4so Coyotes and scours and spring blizzards theyre a pack against us Why give in to the sonofabitch side of nature Iask you The Busby brothers Bob and Ken they grew up in Helena and when theywere big enough to be of anyhelp their uncle Guy Busby imported them out here assummer han4so No small portion of their work was the chore of mending the ranchs barbwire gates every timeGuy drove through them on the way home from a spree We were misfortunate enough to come out here to work for old Unk just after he baught his first car A ModelT He figured it was a wonderful advance you know Any time he wanted now he could scoot in to Gros Ventre and get lit Old Guy gave out before the worlds whiskey didsome say the notion of Prohibition sent his blood pressure soaring beyond what the human body can standand ever since Bob and Ken had been trying to rebuild the Busby Thank the Lord that Unk was into sheep instead of anything ele Not even he could entirely drink up thewool money before the lamb money cameo Don Frew possessed of a college degree 71 in agriculture and thus guilty until he could ever manage to prove himself innocent of a ranching communitys automatic an educated fool Don knew his stuff when it came to running a sheep ranch but behind his back everyone imitated his perpetual response whenever he was asked when he was going to start lambing or haying or whatever That will take some thinking abouto Charlie Finletter a close manager as was said both in admiration and not who never left a herder more than three cans of vegetables a week for fear body would rob the sheepwagon But then having to live in the time of theNew Deal was an extenuating circumstance for anybody with Charlies view of finances News of the WPA wages being paid during the building of FortPeck dam over in the eastern part of the state convinced Charlie that FranklinDelano Roosevelt was making the world wobble on its axis I wouldnt pay any man fifty cents an hotJro No man is worth that mucho J L Hill lank and pale and palsied but still pushing along and still a man of high insistence about anything to do with his sheep such as immediately firing any herder suspected of siccing the dog on them too freely Sheep dont eat with their feet so running aint ever going to fatten them And of course Dode Withrow of the moment and Walter Kyle and Fritz Hahn to be met up with on tomorrows stage of this counting tripo Different asclouds these English Creek ranchers in a lot of their ways Yet they all were genuine sheepmen all survivors of the annual war waged on them by Montana weather and the Depression and from the flanks of the Rockies out onto the plains where the farming began they and othermen like them had made the Two country an empire of 72 At the counting vee my father was waiting for After greetings had been said all around among him and Dode and Pat Dode handed my father a gunny sack with a couple of handfuls of cottoncake in it said Start em Mac and stepped around to his side of the counting gate that Up at Palookaville where the dozen bands summered on the north end of the Two entered the mountains all at the same place there was an actual counting corralo But here on the spreadout English Creek range the count was done on eachallotment through a vee made of poles spiked onto trees the sheep funneling through while my father and the rancher stood beside the opening at the narrow end and counted Now my father went through the narrow gate into the vee to the front of the He shook the sack in front of him where the sheep couldsee it and let a few cottonseed pellets trickle to the ground Then it came that sound not even close to any other in this world my fathers coax to the sheep the tonguemade prrrrrprrrrr prrrrr remotely a cross between an enormous cats purr and the cooing of a dove Maybe it was all the rs built into a Scotch tongue but for whatever reason my father could croon that luring call better than any sheepman of the Two Dode and Pat and I watched now as a first cluster of ewes attentive to the source of the prrrrrs caught the smell of the cottoncake They scuffled did some ewely butting of each other as usual to no conclusion then forgot rivalryand swarmed after the cottoncakeo As they snooped forward on the trail of more they led other sheep out the gate and started the count You couldput sheep through theeye of a needle if you once got the first ones going so that the others could 73 turn off their brains and followo My job was at the rear of the sheep with the herder tokeep the band pushing through the counting hole and to see that none circled around after they d been through the vee and got tallied twiceor had this been Ed Van Bebbers band I would have been back there to see that his herder on instructions from Ed didnt spill some sheep around the wing of the corral while the count was going on so that they missed being tallied into the allotment But since these were Dodes sheep with Pat Hoy on hand at the back of them I had little to add to the enterprise of the moment and was there mostly for shqwo I always watched Pat all I could without seeming to stare to try learn how he mastered these woolies as he did Some way he was able just tolook ewes into behaving better than they had in mindo One old independent biddy or another would step out size up her chance of breaking past Pat figure out who she was facing and then shy off back into the rest of the buncho This of course didnt work with lambs who have no more predictability to them than hens in ahurricane But in their case all Pat had to do was say Round em Taffy and his carmelcolored shepherd dog would be sluicing them back to where they It A sheepdog as good as was worth his weight in shoe And a herder as savvy as Pat knew how to be a diplomat toward his dog rewarding him every now and then with praise and ear rubbing but not babying him so much that the dog hung around waitingto be complimented rather than performing his work That was one of my fathers basic instructions when I first began going into 74 the mountains with him on counting trips not to get too affectionate with any herders dog Simply stroke them a time or two if they nuzzled me and let it go at thato Taffy came over now to see if I had any stray praise to offer and I just said Youre a dog and half Taffy Grass gets much higher up here Jick Im liable to lose Taffy in it11 Pat called over to me You eversee such a jungle of a year No I confessed and we made conversation for a bit about the summers prospectso Pat Hoy looked like any of a thousand geezers you could find in the hiring bars of First Avenue South in Great Falls but he was a true grassaroo knew how to graze sheep as if the grass was his own sustenance as well as theirs No herder in all of the Two country was more highly prized than Pat the ten months of the year when he stayed sober and behind the sheep and because this was so Dode put up with what was necessary to hang onto himo That is put up with the fact that some random number of times a year Pat proclaimed to him I quit by damn you can herd these oldnellies your own self Take me to town Dode knew that only two of those quitting proclamations ever meant anything The sonofagun has to have a binge after the lambs are shipped and then another one just before lambing time go down to Great Falls and get all bent out of shapeo Hes got his pattern down like linoleum Pat haso For the first week he whiskey and his women are pretty good Thenext week or so hes mostly on beer and his women are getting a little shabby Then for about two weeks after that hes on straight wine and First Avenue squawso That gets it out 75 of his system and I go collect him andwestart all You can see how being around Dode and Pat lifted our dispositions When the count was done andwe had helped Pat start the sheep on up toward the range he would summer them onthe ewes and lambs already browsing taking their first of however many million nibbles of grass would ensue on the Two between then and SeptemberDode stayed on with us a while to swap talko Whats new with Uncle Sam he inquiredo Roosevelt doesnt tell me quite everything understand my father responded We are going modern thougho It has only taken half of my goddamn life but the Billy Peak lookout is about built Paul will have her done in the next couple days This forest is finally going to have a goddamn fire tower evertlace itought to have Oleo Naturally its happening during a summer when the forest is more apt to float d away than burn down but anywqyo Dode was a compact whose listening grin featured a gap where the sharp tooth just to the left of hi front teeth was missing knocked out in some adventure or A Dode tale was that when he and Midge were about to be married he told her that he intended to really dude up for the wedding even planned to stick a navy bean in thetooth gqpa But if Dode looked and acted as if he always was ready to take on life heqdfirst he also was one of those rare ones who could listen as earnestly as he could talko Alec still keeping a saddle warm at the Double W Dode was asking ne4to Still is my father had to confirm 76 Dode caughtthe gist behind the tight pair of words forhe went on to relate That goddamn Williamson He can be an overbearing sonofabitch without halftrying Ill say that for him A while back I ran into him in the Medicine Lodge andwe sopped up a few drinks together then he got to razzing me about cattle being a higher class of animal than Finally I told him wendell answer me this Whenever you see a picture of Jesus Christ which is it hes holding in his arms Always a LAMB never a goddamn calf We hooted over that For the first time all day my father didnt look as if hed eaten nails for breakfast Anyway Dode assured us Alecll pretty soon figure out there are other people to work for in the world than Wendell goddamn Williamson Life is wide theres room to take a new run at ito My father wagged his headas if he hoped so but was dubious Howabout you yousee a nickel in sight anywhere this year So now it was Dodes turn to report and my father just as keenly welcomed in hisinformation that down on theMusselshell a wool consignment of thirty thousand fleeces had gone for 22 cents a pound highest in years encouragement that could goddamn near make a man think about staying in the sheep business and that Dode himself didnt intend to shear until around the end of the month unless the weather turns christly hot and thatI put myself against a tree and enjoyed the sight and sound of the two of them All the English Creek sheepmen and my father generally got along like hand and glove but Dode was special beyond thqt I 77 suppose it could be said that he and my fatherwere out of the same bina At least it doesnt stretch my imagination much to think that if circumstances had changed sides when the pair of them were young it now could have been Dode standing there in the employ of the UQS Forest Service and my father in possession of a sheep rancho Their friendship actually went back to before either of them had what could be called a career to when they both were broncpunks youngsters riding in Egans big round corral at Noon Creek every sunnner Sunday My father loved to tell that Dode earned a lasting reputation the Sunday he showed up wearing a new pair of corduroy pants with leather trimDode could be a snazzy dresser whenever there was any occasionand found everybody gathered around astranger from Fort Bentono The stranger possessed a bucking steer and the standing wager that nobody could stay aboard himfor a total of 5 minutes within a hqlfhour span Dode snapped up theoffero Then got a closer lookat the animal and began to realize what he was in foro Hestrapped and tied on his saddle in every direction he could think of jammed his boots into the stirrups and had the lers turn the steer and him loose When the half hour was up the steer had scraped and split Dodes fancy corduroy pants to tatters and he needed to borrow something to go home in But Dode also had totaled between spills and remounts five minutes and twenty seconds on the steers Anybody can be a bareback rider my father always concluded intelling the corduroy pants story but it took Dode to ride barebutt By this time of afternoon afew clouds had concocted themselves 78 above the crest of the mountains and were drifting one after another out over the foothills below Small fleecy puffs the kind which during the dry years made people disgustedly joke that Those are empties from Seattle going overo This year it did not matter that they werent rainbringers and with the backdrop of my father and Dodes conversation I lost myself in watching each cloud shadow cover a hill or a portion of a ridgeline and then flow down across the coulee toward the next as if the shadow was a slow mock flood sent by the 1 hear nature calling Dode now was excusing himselfo He headed off not toward the timber though but to a rock outcropping about 40 yards away roughly as big and high as a onestory house When Dode climbed up onto that I figured I had misunderstood his mission he evidently was clambering up there to look along the mountain and check on Pats progress with the sheep But no he proceeded to do that and the other too gazing off up the mountain slope as he unbuttoned and peedo Do you know even as I say this I again see Dode in every particulqr Hisleft hand resting on his hip and the arm and elbow kinked out like the handle on a coffee cup His hat tilted back at an inquiring angle He looked composed as a statue up there if you can imagine stone spraddled out in commemoration of that particular human function MY father and I grinned until our faces almost split There is only one Dode he said Then he cupped his hands and called out in a concerned tone Dode I hope youve got a good foothold up there Because yousure dont haveall thatmuch of a handhold 79 Bythe timeDode declared he had to head down the mountain toward home pronto or face consequences from his wife Midge Iactually was almost in the mood that a counting trip deserved For I knew that traveling to tomorrows sheep those of Walter Kyle and Fritz Hahn would take us up onto Roman Reef always topnotch country and after that would come the interesting prospect of the new Billy Peak lookout tower It had not escaped me either that on our way to that pair of attractions we would spend tonight at a camping spot along the North Fork urrler Rooster Mountain which my father arrl Iand yes Alec in years pastconsidered our favorite in the entire Two Flurre Gulch tre locale was called because an odd high gully with steep sides veered in from the south and poured a trickle of water down tlB gorge wall into too North Fork If you had to walk any of that Flume Gulch side of the creek you would declare the terrain had tried to starrl itself on errl and prop i tsell up with thick timber and a crisscross of wirrlfalls But go on tie opposite side of the creek and up onto too faciq and equally steep slope of Rooster Mountain arrl you would turn arourrl and say yoo d never been in a grassier mountain meadow o Tm t is the pattern the seasons makB in this part of the Two a facirg slope bursting with trees because snow stays longest there and provides moisture while a slope is timberless but grassy because of all the sun it gets Anyway wild arrl tumbled country Flume Gulch but as pretty as you could ask for By just before dusk my father and I were there and Mouse and Pony and Homer were unsaddled and tethered on the gocd grass of the Rooster Mountain arrl camp was established 79A You know where supper is my father advised By which he meant that it was in the creek waitingto be caughto This far up the North Fork English Creek didnt amount to much Most places you could cross it in a running juinpo But the stream washeaded downout of the mountains in a hurry and so had some pretty riffles and every now and again a pool like a big wide stairstep of 80 glaSo If fish werent in one of those waters they were in the other a Each of us took our hat off and unwound the fishline and hook wrapped around the hatband Onour way up before the willows gave out we had cut a pair of decent length and now notched them about an inch from the small end tied each fishline snug into each notch so it couldnt pull off and were readyto talk business with those fi9h Hide behind a tree to bait your hook my father warned with an almoststraight face or theyll swarm rightout of the waterafter you My father still had a reputation in the Forest Service from the time some Region One headquarters muckymuck who was quite a dryfly fisherman asked him what these English Creek trout took best Those guys of course have a whole catechism of hackles and muddlers and goofus bugs and stone flies and nymphs and midgeso Chicken guts my father inf armed htm We didnt happen to have any of those along with us but just before leavinome wed gone to the old haystack bottom near the barn and dugourselves each a tobacco can of angleworms Why in holy hell anyone thinks a fish would pref er a dab of hair to something as plump as a stackbottom worm I never have understood the reasoning of The fish in fact began to prove that right then I do make the concession to sportsmanship that Ill fish a riffle once in a while even though it demands some attention to casting instead of just plunking into the stream and so it pleased me a little that in thenext half hour or so I pulled my 10 fish out of bumpy water9 while at the pool hed 81 chosen to workover my father still was short of his I can about taste that milkshake I warned him as Iheaded downstream a little to clean my Theoretically there was a bet in our family that anybody who fished and didnt catch owed the others a milkshakeo My father had thought this up some sunnners ago to interest Alec who didnt care anything for fishing but always was keen to compete But after the tally mounted through the years to where Alec owed my father and me eight milkshakes each during last years counting trip Alec declared himself out and left the fishing to us And the two of us were currently evenstephen each hook ten having once all of last summer Im just corraling them first my father explained as he dabbed a fresh worm to the poql What I intend is to get fish so thick in here theyll run into each other and knock theirselves out The fish must have heard and taken pity because by the time Id gutted mine here he came with his What I inquired as innocently as I could manage did you decide to forfeit Likehell mister Ten brookies right before your very eyes Since youre so advanced in all this go dig out the frying pan Even yet I could live and thrive on that Flume Gulch meal procedure fry up both catches of fish eat as many for supper as we could hold resume on the rest at breakfat Those little brookies Eastern brook trout about 8 inches long are among thebest eating there can be You begin to taste them as quick as they hit the frying pan and go into their 82 curl Brown them up and take them in your fingers and eat them like corn on the cob and you wish you had the capacity for a hundred of them When wed devoured 5 or so brookies apiece we slowed down enough to share out a can of pork and beans then resumed on the last stint of our fish supper That hold you my father asked when we each had made 7 or 8 trout vanisho I bobbed that I guessed it would and while he went to the creek to rinse off our tin plates and scour the frying pan with gravel I set to work composing his days diary entry That the UQS Forest Service wantedto know in writing what hed done with his day constituted my fathers single most chronic bother about being a ranger Early on someone told him the story of another down on the Shoshone national forest in Wyoming Trinnned my horses tail and the wind blewall day read the fellows first diary tryo Then with further thought he managed to conclude From the northeast My father could swallow advice if he had to and so he did what he could with the perpetual nag of having to jot his activities into the diary When he did it was entirely another matter Two or three weeks he would stay dutiful then came a Saturday morning when he had seven little yellow blank pages to show for his week and the filling in had to start Bet whatd I do on Tuesday That the day it rained and I worked on Mazoola paperwork That was Wednesday Tuesday you rode up to look over the range 83 above Noon I thought that was Thursdayo You can think so if you like but youd be wrongo My mother was careful to seem halfexasperated about these scriving sessions but I think she looked forward to the chance to set my father straight on history even if it was only the past weekso Thursday I baked and you took a rhubarb pie for the Bowens when you went tothe Indian Head stationo Not that Louise Bowen is capable of recognizing a pieo Well then when I rode to theGuthrie Peak lookout that only yesterday Friday Today is Saturday yesterday most likely was Friday my mother was glad to confirm for him When I became old enough to go into the mountains with him on counting trips my father perceived relief for his diary situation Previously he had tried Alec but Alec had the same later proclivity as his I think we had not gone a mile along the trailabove the South Forkthatvery first morning when he reined up said as if it had just occurred to him out of nowhere Jick whynt you kind of keep track of today for me11 and presented me a freshsharpened stub pencil and a pocket noteboqk It did take a little doing to catch onto my fathers styleo But after those first days of my reporting into my notebook in the manner of We met up with Dill Egan on the south side of Noon Creek and talked with him about whether he canget a bigger allotment to run ten more steers on and my father squashingit down in his diary to SawD Egan about steer proposition I 84 By now I was veteran enough that the day came readily to the tip of my pencLL Patroled another principle some early ranger had imparted to my father was that if you so much as left the station to go to the outhouse you had patroledPatroled theno fork of English Creek CountedD Withrows sheep onto allotment Commenced packing bolts and flangesand cable to BillyPeaklookout site My father readit over and noddedo Change that bolts and flanges and cable just to geqr You dont want to be any more definite than necessary in any love note to Uncle Sam But otherwise it reads like thevery Biblee So the day wassummed and we had dined on trout and the campfire wasputting warmth and light between us and the night and we had nothing that needed doing except to contemplate until sleep overcame My father was lying back against his saddle hands behind his head and his hat tippedforward over his forehead Ever since a porcupineattracted by the salt of horse sweat had chewed hell out of Alecs saddle on the counting trip a couple or three years ago we made it a policy to keep our saddles by Hecould make himself more comfortable beside a campfire than body else I ever knew my father couldo Right now he looked like he could spend till dawn talking over the Two country and everything in if Toussaint Rennie or Dode Withrow had been on hand to do it with My thoughts though still circled around Alecwell sure somewhat onto Leona tooand what had erupted at supper last nighto But again the reluctance lodged itself in me against outright asking 85 my father what hethought the prospect waswhere Alec was concerned I supposethere are times a persondoesnt want to hearpure truth Instead I brought out else that had been dogging my mindo Dad Do you ever wonder about being somebody else Such as who JohnD Rockefeller What I mean I got to thinking from watching you and Dode together there at the counting vee Just you know whether youd ever thought about how he could be in your place and you in hiso Which would give me three daughters instead of you and Alec do youmean Maybe Ill saddle up Mouse and go trade him right nowo No not thqt I mean life generally Him being the ranger and youbeing the sheepman is what I had in If things had gone a little different back when you guys were uh young Were my age was of coursewhat was hidingbehind Dode jaw to jaw with the Major Now I know Im going to head down the mountain and swap straight across9 for the sake of seeing thqt Tuthat time the regional forester the boss of everybody in the national forests of Montana and Idaho was Evan Kelleyo Major Kelley forhe was like a lot of guys who got a big army rank during the war hung on to the title ever afterward as if it was sainthood The Majors style of leadership was basico When he said frog everybody better junip I wish I had a nickelfor every time my father opened the mail from Missoula and muttered Oh Jesus another kelleygram When does he eversleep Everybody did admit the Major at least madeclear the gospelin his messages to his Forest Service men What he prescribed from his rangers were no big forest fires and no guff So far my 86 fathers slate was clean of botho Inthose years I didnt give the matter particular thought but I recognize now that my fathers long stint in charge of the English Creek district of the TwoMedicine National Forest could only have happened with the blessing of the Maj or himself The Pope in Missoula so to speako Nobodylower could haveshielded ranger Varick McCaskill from the transfers that ordinarily happened everyfew years or so in the Forest Service No the Major wanted that tricky nortlnnost portion of the Two surrounded as so much of it was by to be other government domains rangered in a way that wouldnt draw the Forest Service any bowwow fromthe neighboring Glacier Park staff or the Blackfeet Reservationpeople and in a way that would keep the sheepmen content and the revenue they paid for sunnner allotments flowing in and in a waythat would not repeat the awful fires of 1910 or the later Phantom Woman Mountain burn right in here above the North Fork And that washow my father was rangering ito So far I guess I know what youre driving at thougho My father sat up enough toput his boot against a pine piece of squaw wood and shove it farther into the fire then lay back against his saddle again How come we do what we do in life instead of something eleo But I dont knqwo I do not knqwo All Ive ever been able to figure out Jick is that no job fits as well as a person would like it to but some of us fit the job better than others do That sorts matters out a litteo Yeah well I gueirno But how do you get in the job in the first place to find out whether youre going to fit it 87 You watch for a chanceto tryit is aJlo Sometimes the chance comes looking for youo Sometimes you got to look for it Myself I had my taste of the army because of the war And it took goddamn little of army lie to tell me huhuh not for me Then when I landed back here I got to be association rider for Noon Creek by setting out to get it I gues youd say What I did I went around to Dill Egan and old Thad Wainwright and your granddad Isaac and the other Noon Creekers and asked if theyd keep me in mind when it came time to sunnner the cows up here Of course it maybe didnt particularly hurt that I mentioned how happy Id be to keep Double W cows from slopping over onto the Noon Creek guys allotments as had been going on way the job got to be mieo What the Double W was running cattle up here then Were they They had an allotment in the early days A hellish big oe Back then the Williamsons didnt have hold of all that Noon Creek country to graze So yeah they had forest range and sneaked cows onto anybody elses whenever they couJd The number one belief of old Warren Williamson you know was that other peoples grass might justas well be his I didnt know Warren Williamson father of the present Double W honcho was before my time or at least died in California before I was old enough for it to mean anything to me Ill say this one thing for Wendell my father went on he at least buys or rents the countryo Old Warren figured he could just take ito He gavethe pine piece another shove with his booto The lasting damn Double W The GobbleGobble You as the gent who was 88 ranger when I was association rider used to call it Is that I had it in mind to ask if that was why he and my mother were so dead set against Alec staying on at the Double W those old contentions between the Williamsons ranch and the rest of the Two countryo But no the McCaskill next to me here in the fireshine was a readier topic than my absent Is that how you got to be the ranger here Setting out to get the job He went still for a moment lying there in that sloped position against the saddle feet toward the fiieo Then shook his heqdo The Forest Service generally doesnt work that way and the Major sure as hell Point yourself at the Two and theyre liable to plunk youdownonthe Beaverhead or over onto the Bitterroot Or doghouse you in the Selway back when therestill was a Selwqyo No I didnt aim myself at English It happened I was readying to point out to him that it happened wasnt a real full explanation of job history when he sat up and moved his hat back soas to send hisattentiontoward meo What about you on all this Somebody you think youd rather be is there he had me My turn to be less than complete I answered Not rather really a Just might have been is allo An answer that didnt even start toward truth that one wqs And not the one I would have resorted to any time up untilsupper of the night befoie For until then if I was to imagine myself happening to be anybody else who could the first candidate have been but Alec 89 Wasnt all the basicoutline already there Same bloodline same place of growing up same schooling maybe even the same bodyframe if I kept growing at my recent pace Both of us September arrivals into the world evenonly the years needed swapping The remarkable thing to me was that our interests in life were as different as they were and I suppose I had more or less assumed that time was going to bring mine around to about where Alecs wereo But now precisely this possibility was what was unsettling I can only describe it something like this that previous night at the supper table when Alec made his announcement about him and Leona and I asked How come what I intended maybe was something similar to what my parents were asking of Alec Something like Already What was the rush How could marriage and all be happening this soon to my own brother Yes maybe put it this way what I felt or at least sensed and was trying to draw into focus was the suggestion that Alecs recent course of behavior in some way foreshadowed my own Might have been after all has withinit might beo It was like looking through the Toggery window in Gros Ventre at a fancy suit of clothes and saying bythe Christ theyll never catch me dead irt But at the same time noticing that they seem to be your exact fito Like who my father was asking in a tone which signaledme that he was asking it for the second tme Who I echoed trying to think of anything more Country seems to be full of owls tonight he joked Yet he was still attentive enough that I knew I had to come up with something that resembled an answer 90 Oh Yeaho Wboo I looked at the fire for some chunk that needed kickingfurther in and although none really did I kicked one anywayo Well like Rayo Thats all I had in mind was Ray and meo Ray Heaney was my best friend at high school in Gros Us being the same age and all like you and Dode This brought curiosity into my fathers regard of Now that takes some imagination he said Dode and me are Siamese twins compared to you and Rayo Then he rose dusting twigs and pine needles off the back of him fromwherehe had laLno But Iguess imagination isnt a shortage with you You maybe could supply the rest of us as well huh Anyway lets give some thought to turning Lno We got a day ahead of us tomorrowo If I was a believer in omens the start of that next morning ought to have told me something The rigarnarole of untangling out of our bedrolls and getting the campfire going and making sure the horses hadnt quit the country during the night all that went usual enougho Then though my father glanced around at me from where he had the coffee pot heating over a corner of the fire and asked Readyfor a cup Alec Well that will happen in a family A passing shadowof mindedness or the tongue just slipping a cog from what was intended Ordinarily being miscalled wouldnt have riled me at all But all this recent connnotion about Alec and my own wondering about where 90A anybody in this family stood any more and that fireside spell of brooding Id done on my brother and myself and I dont know what the hell all elseit now brought a response which scraped out of me like flint Im the other one Surprise passed over my o Then I guess what is called contrition Yousure as hell are he agreed in a low voice Unmistakably Jick 91 About my name John Angus McCaskill I was christened As soon as I began at the South Fork school though and gained a comprehension of what had been done to me I put away that Angus for good I have thought ever since that using a middle name is like having a third nostril I hadnt considered this before but by then the John must already have been amended out of all recognition too At least I can find no memory of ever being called that so the change must have happened pretty early in life According to my mother it next became plain that Johnnie didnt fit the boy I was either Somehow it just seemed like calling rhubarb vanilla and she may or may not have been making a joke With her you couldnt always tell Anyhow the family story goes on that she and my father were trying me out as Jack when some visitor noticing that I had the McCaskill red hair but gray eyes instead of everybody elses blue and more freckles than Alec and my father combined and not such a pronouncement of jaw as theirs said something like He looks to me more like the jick of this family So I got dubbed for the offcard For the jack that shares only the color of the jack of trumps That is to say in a card game such as pitch if spades are led the jack of clubs becomes the jick and in the taking of tricks the abiding rule is that jack takes jick but jick takes joker I explain this a bit because I am constantly dumfounded by how many people even here in Montana no longer can play a decent hand of cards I believe television has got just a hell of a lot to answer for Anyway Jick I became and have ever been That is part of the pondering that I find myself doing now Whether some other name would 92 have shifted my life any Yet of what I might change I keep deciding that that would not be among the first This breakfast incident rankled a little even after my father and I saddled up and resumed the ride toward the Roman Reef counting vee where we were to meet Walter Kyles sheep at around noon Nor did the weather help any Clouds closed off the peaks of the mountains and while it wasnt raining yet the air promised that it intended to One of those days too clammy to go without a slicker coat and too muggy to wear one in comfort To top it all off we now were on the one stretch of the trail coming into sight ahead of I never liked with the Phantom Woman Mountain burn on the slope us Everywhere over there acre upon acre upon acre a gray cemetery of snags and stumps Of death by fire for the Phantom Woman forest fire had been the one big one in the Twos history except for the blazing summer of 1910 Ahead of me my father was studying across at the burn in the gloomy way he always did here Both of us now moping along like sorrows orphans If I didnt like the Phantom Woman neighborhood my father downright despised it Plainly he considered this gray dead mountainside the blot on his forest In those times when firefighting was done mainly by hand a runaway blaze was the bane of the Forest Service My fathers slate was as clean as could be except for unavoidable smudges before strikes could be snuffed out timber and grass everywhere else on English Creek ranger district were intact even much of the 1910burnt 93 country restoring itself by now But the awful scar here was unhealed yet Not that the Phantom Woman fire was in any way my fathers own responsibility for it happened before this district was his while he still was the ranger at Indian Head rather than here He was called in as part of the fire crewthis was a blaze that did run wild for a while a whole hell of a bunch of men ended up fighting Phantom Woman before they controlled itbut that was all You couldnt tell my father that though and this morning I wasnt in a humor to even try When time has the weight of a mood such as ours on it it slows to a creep Evidently my father figured both the day and I could stand some brightening Anyway it was considerably short of noonwe were about twothirds of our way up Roman Reef where the North Fork hides itself in a timber canyon below and the trail bends away from the face of Phantom Woman to the other mountains beyondwhen he turned atop Mouse and called to me Hows an early lunch sound to you Suits me I of course assured him Out like this my father tended to survive on whatever jumped out of the food pack first He did have the principle that supper needed to be a cooked meal especially if it could be trout But as for the rest of the day if trout werent available he was likely to offer up as breakfast a couple of slices of headcheese and a can of tomatoes or green beans and if you didnt watch him he might do the exact same again for lunch My mother consequently always made us up enough slab sandwiches for three days worth of lunches Of course Iv 94 by the second noon in that high air the bread was about dry enough to strike a match on but still a better bet than whatever my father was apt to concoct We had eaten an applebutter sandwich and a half apiece and were sharing a can of peaches for dessert harpooning the slices out with our jackknives to save groping into the pack for utensils when Mouse suddenly snonted Stand still a minute my father instructed which I embarked on Meanwhile he stepped carefully backward the three or four paces until he was beside the scabbard on Mouse with the 3006 rifle in it That time of year in the Two the thought was automatic in anybody who at all knew what he was doing look around for bears for they are coming out of hibernation cantankerous What Mouse was signaling however proved to be a rider appearing at the bend of the trail downhill from us He was on a blazeface sorrel who in turn snorted at the sight of uso A black pack mare followed into sight then a light gray pack horse with spots on his nose and his neck stretched out and his lead rope taut Somebodys new camptender must be my father said and resumed on our peaches The rider sat in his saddle that permanent way a lot of those oldtimers did as if he lived up there and couldnt imagine sufficient reason to venture down off the back of a horse Not much of his face showed between the buttonedup slicker and the pulleddown brown Stetson But thinking back on it now I am fairly sure that my father at once 95 recognized both the horseman and the situation The brief packstring climbed steadily to us the ears of the horses sharp in interest at us and Pony and Horner and Mouse The rider showed no attention until he was right up to us Then though I didnt see him do anything with the reins the sorrel stopped and the Stetson veered half out over the slickered shoulder nearest us Hullo Mac I had half a hunch it might be you Stanley How the hell are you Still able to sit up and take nourishment Hullo Alec or Jick as the case may be I had not seen him since I was whatfour years old five Yet right then I could have tolled off to you a number of matters about Stanley Meixell That he was taller than he looked on that sorrel built in the riderly way of length mostly from his hips down That he had once been an occasional presence at our meals stooping first over the wash basin for a cleanse that included the back of his neck and then slicking back his hairI could have said too that it was crowblack and started from a widows peakbefore corning to the table That unlike a lot of people he did not talk down to children never delivered them phony guff such as Think youll ever amount to anything That instead he once set Alec and me to giggling to the point where my mother threatened to send us from the table when he told us with a straight face that where he came from they called milk moo juice and eggs cackleberries and molasses longtailed sugar Yet of his ten or so years since we had Iv 96 last seen him I couldnt have told you anything whatsoever So it was odd how much immediately arrived back to mind about this unexpected man Jick I clarified Lo Stanley It was my fathers turn to pick up the conversation Thought I recognized that black pack mare Back up in this country to be campjack for the Busby boys are you Yeah Stanleys yeah was that Missourian sloweddown kind almost in two parts yehuh And his voice sounded huskier than it ought to as if a rasp had been used across the top of it Yeah these times I guess being campjack is better than no jack at all Protocol was back to him now He asked my father Counting them onto the range are you Withrows band yesterday and Kyles and Hahns today Quite a year for feed up here Thiss been a million dollar rain aint it Brought the grass up asshigh to a tall Indian Though Im getting to where I could stand a little sunshine to thaw out with myself Probably have enough to melt you my father predicted soon enough Could be Stanley looked ahead up the trail as if just noticing that it continued on from where we stood Could be he repeated Nothing followed that either from stanley or my father and it began to come through to me that this conversation was seriously kinked in some way These two men had not seen each other for the larger part of ten years So why didnt they have anything to say to one another besides this smallchange talk about weather and grass And already were running low on that And both were wearing a careful look as if the trail suddenly was a slippery place V CJ 97 Finally my father offered Want some peaches A few in here we havent stabbed dead yet Naw thanks I got to head on up the mountain or Ill have sheepherders after my hide Yet Stanley did not quite go into motion seemed somehow to be storing up an impresion of the pair of us to take with him My father fished out another peach slice and handed me the can to finish Along with it came his casual question What was it you did to your hand It took me a blink or two to realize that although he said it in my direction the query was intended for Stanley I saw then that a handkerchief was wrapped around the back of Stanleys right hand and that he was resting that hand on the saddle horn with his 1eft hand atop it the reverse of usual procedure there Also as much of the handkerchief as I could see had started off white but now showed stains like dark rust You know how it is that Bubbles cayuseStanley tossed a look over his shoulder to the gray pack horsewas kind of snakey this morning Tried to kick me into next week Took some skin off is all We contemplated Bubbles As horses go he looked capable not just of assault but maybe pillage and plunder and probably arson too He was ewenecked and accented that feature by stretching back stubbornly against the lead rope even now that he was standing still the Forest Service packer Isidor Pronovost called such a creature You sometimes wonder if the sunnabitch mightnt tow easier if you was to tip him over I f 98 onto his back The constellation of dark nose spots which must have given Bubbles his nameat least I couldnt see anything else nameable about himdrew a persons attention but if you happened to glance beyond those markings you saw that Bubbles was peering back at you as if hed like to be standing on your spine How such creatures get into pack strings I just dont know I suppose the same way Good Help Hebners and Ed Van Bebbers get into the human race I dont remember you as having much hide to spare my father said then to Stanley During the viewing of Bubbles the expression on my fathers face had shifted from careful He now looked as if hed made up his mind about something Suppose you could stand some company Awful casual as if the idea had just strolled up to him out of the trees Probably its no special fun running a packstring onehanded Now this was a prince of an offer but of course just wasnt possible Evidently my father had gone absentminded again this time about the counting obligation hed mentioned not ten sentences earlier I was just set to remind him of our appointment with Walters and Fritzs sheep when he added on Jick here could maybe ride along with you I hope I didnt show the total of astonishment I felt Some must have lopped over though because Stanley promptly enough was saying Aw no Mac Jicks got better things to do than haze me along Think about morning my father came back at him Those packs and knots are gonna be several kinds of hell unless youre more handed than youve ever shown 99 Aw no Ill be out a couple or three days you know Longer if any of thoseherders have got trouble Jicks been out that long with me any number of times And your cookings bound to be better for him than mine Well Stanley began and stopped Christamighty he seemed to be considering Matters were passing me by before I could even see them coming I will always credit Stanley Meixell for putting the next two questions in the order he did It ought to be up to Jick11 Stanley looked directly down at me How do you feel about playing nursemaid to somebody so goddamn dumb as to get hisself kicked The corner of my eye told me my father suggested a pretty enthusiastic response to any of this Oh I feel fine aboutI mean sure Stanley I could uh ride along If you really want Yeah Stanley looked down at my father now Mac you double sure itd be okay Even I was able to translate that What was my father going to face from my mother for sending me off camptending into the mountains with Stanley for a number of days Sure my father stated as if the brain for Bring him back when hes out behind the ears Well then The brown Stetson tipped up maybe two inches and Stanley swung a slow look around at the pines and the trail and the 100 mountainslope as if this was a site he might want to remember More of his face showed Dark eyes blueblack Into the corners of them a lot of routes of squint wrinkles Thin thrifty nose Thrift of line at the mouth and too A face with no waste to it In fact a little worn down by use was the impression it gave I guess we ought to be getting Stanley proposed Got everything you need Jick I had no idea in hell what I needed for going off into the Rocky Mountains with a onehanded campjack I mean I was wearing my slicker coat my bedroll was behind my saddle my head was more or less on my shoulders despite the jolt of surprise that all this had sent through me but were those nearly enough Anyway I managed to blurt I guess so Stanley delivered my father the longest gaze he had yet See you in church Mac he said then nudged the sorrel into motion The black pack horse and the light gray ugly one had passed us by the time I swung onto Pony and my father was standing with his thumbs in his pockets looking at the series of three horse rumps and the back of Stanley Meixell as I reined around onto the trail I stopped beside 0 him long enough to see if he was going offer any explanation or instructions or edification of any damn sort at all His face still full of that decision said he wasnt All I got from him was Jick hes worth knowing But I already know him No response to that None in prospect The hell with it I rode past my father and muttered as I did Dont forget to do the diary I 101 Thanks for reminding me my father said pokerfaced Ill give it my utmost The Busby brothers I knew ran three bands of sheep on their forest allotment which stretched beneath the cliff face of Roman Fork 0f Eug ek Stanley had slowed beyond the first bend of the trail for me to catch up or maybe to make sure I actually was coming along on this grand tour of sheepherders Which camp do we head for first I called ahead to him Canada Dans hes the closest About under that promontory in the Reef is where his wagon is If we sift right along for the next couple hours or so well be there Stanley and the sorrel were on the move again in that easy style longtime riders and their accustomed horses have One instant you see the pair of them standing and the next you see them in motion together and theres been no rigamarole in between Stopped and now going thats all But Stanley did leave behind for me the tion Quite a day to be going places aint it Yeah I guess It couldnt have been more than fifteen minutes after we left my father though when Stanley reined his horse off the trail into a little clearing and the packhorses followed When I rode up alongside he said I got to go visit a tree You keep on ahead Jick Ill catch right up I had the trail to myself for the next some minutes Just when I was about to rein around and see what had become of Stanley the white I 102 of the sorrels blaze flashed into sight Be right there s tanley called motioning me to ride on But he caught up awfully gradually and in fact must have made a second stop when I went out of sight around a switchback And before long he was absent again This time when he didnt show up and didnt show up I halted Pony and waited As I was about to go back and start a search here Stanley came calling out as before Be right there I began to wonder a bit Not only had I been volunteered into this expedition by somebody other than myself I sure as the devil had not signed on to lead it So the next time Stanley lagged from sight I was determined to wait until he was up with me And as I sat there on Pony firmly paused I began to hear him long before I could see him My name she is Pancho I work on a rancho I make a dollar a day Stanleys singing voice surprised me a clearer younger tone than his raspy talk So did his song I go to see Suzy Shes got a doozy Suzy take my dollar away When Stanley drew even with me I still couldnt see much of his eyes under the brim of the pulleddown hat although I was studying pretty hard this time v n 0 103 Yessir Stanley announced as the sorrel stopped great day for the race aint it The race I gaped The human race Stanley pivoted in his saddlea little unsteadily black I thoughtenough to scan at mare and then the gray one He got a whiteeyed glower in return from the gray Bubbles there is still in kind of an owly mood Mad because he managed to only kick my hand instead of my head most likely Youre doing fine up ahead Jick Ill wander along behind while Bubbles works on his sulking There was nothing for it but head up the trail again At least now I knew for sure what my situation was If there lingered any last least iota of doubt Stanleys continued disappearances and his ongoing croon dispatched it My brother is Sancho he try with a banjo to coax Suzy to woo I have long thought that the two commonest afflictions in Montanait may be true everywhere but then I havent been everywhereare drink and orneriness True my attitude has thawed somewhat since I have become old enough to indulge in the pair myself now and again But back there on that mountain those years ago all I could think was that I had on my hands the two worst of such representations a behind the bush bottletipper and a knotheaded packhorse 104 But she tell him no luck the price is an extra buck him and the banjo make two I spent a strong hour or so in contemplation of my father and just what he had saddled me with here All the while mad enough to bite sticks in two Innocent as a goddamn daisy I had let my father detour me up the trail with Stanley Meixell And now to find that my trail compadre showed every sign of being a warbling boozehound Couldnt I for Christs sake be told the full extent of the situation before I was shoved into it What was in the head of that father of mine Anything black After this siege a new angle of thought did break through It occurred to me to wonder just how my father ought to have alerted me to Stanleys condition beforehand Cleared his throat and announced Stanley excuse us but Jick and I got something to discuss over here in the jackpines well be right back Worked his way behind Stanley and pantomimed to me a swig from a bottle Neither of those seemed what could be called etiquette and that left me with the perturbing suggestion that maybe itd been up to me to see the situation for myself Which gave me another hour or so of heavy chewing trying to figure out how I was supposed to follow events that sprung themselves on me from nowhere How do you brace for that whatever age you are ICanada Dans sheep were bunched in a long thick line against a n 105 When we rode up a lot of blatting was going on as if there was an uneasiness among them A sheepherder who knows what he is doing in timber probably is good in open country too but vice versa is not necessarily the case and I remembered my father mentioning that Canada Dan had been herding over by Cut Bank plains country A herder new to timber terrain and skittish about it will dog the bejesus out of his sheep keep the band tight together for fear of losing some Canada Dans patchmarked sheepdog looked weary panting and I saw Stanley study considerably the way these sheep were crammed along the slope Been looking for you since day before yesterday Canada Dan greeted us Im goddamn near out of canned milk That so said Stanley Lucky thing near isnt the same as out Canada Dan was looking me up and down now You that rangers kid I didnt care for the way that was put and just said back Jick McCaskill Too I was wondering how many more times that day I was going to need to identify myself to people Id had no farthest intention of getting involved with Canada Dan targeted on Stanley again Got to bring a kid along to play nursemaid for you now Stanley Must be getting on in years I bunged up my hand Stanley responded shortly Jicks been generous enough to pitch in with me Canada Dan shook his head as if my sanity was at issue Hes van 106 gonna regret charity when he sees the goddamn chore we got for ourselves up here What would that be Dan About fifteen head of goddamn dead ones thats what They got onto some deathcamas maybe three days back Poisoned theirselfs before you can say sic em Canada Dan reported all this as if he was an accidental passerby instead of being responsible for these animals Remains of animals they were now Thats a bunch of casualties Stanley agreed I didnt happen to notice the pelts anywhere there at the wag Happened right up over here Canada Dan went on as if he hadnt heard gesturing to the ridge close behind him Just glommed onto that deathcamas like it was goddamn candy Cmon here Ill show you The herder shrugged out of his coat tossed it down on the grass pointed to it and instructed his dog Stay Rags The dog came and lay on the coat facing the sheep and Canada Dan trudged up the ridge without ever glancing back at the dog or us I began to dread the way this was trending The place Canada Dan led us to was a pocket meadow of bunch grass interspersed with pretty white blossoms and with gray mounds here and there on it The blossoms were deathcamas and the mounds were the dead ewes Even as cool as the weather had been they were bloated almost to bursting Thats them the herder identified for our benefit Its sure convenient of you fellows to show up All that goddamn skinning I van 107 can stand all the help I can get Stanley did take the chance to get a shot in on him You been too occupied the past three days to get to them I guess But it bounced off Canada Dan like a berry off a buffalo The three of us looked at the corpses for awhile Theres not all that much conversation to be made about bloated sheep carcasses After a bit though Canada Dan offered in a grim satisfied way Thatll teach the goddamn buggers to eat deathcamas11 Well Stanley expounded next Theres no such thing as handed skinning Which doubled the sense of dread in me I thought to myself But there is onehanded tipping of a bottle and onehanded dragging me into this campjack expedition and onehanded weaseling out of what was impending here next andAll this while Stanley was looking off in some direction fully away from me I can be unloading the grub into Dans wagon while this goes on then come back with the mare sos we can lug these pelts in We got it to do We Guess I better go get at my end of it oig Stanley reined away leading the pack horses toward the sheepwagon and Canada Dan beaded on me Dont just stand there in your tracks kid Plenty of these goddamn pelters for both of us So for the next long while I was delving in ewe carcasses Manhandling each rainsoaked corpse onto its back steadying it there then starting in with that big incision along the belly which if your jackknife slips just a little bit brings the guts pouring out all over Iv n oi 108 your project Slice along the insides of the legs then trim the pelt off the pale dead flesh It grudges me even now to say it but Stanley was accurate it did have to be done because the pelts at least would bring a dollar apiece for the Busby brothers and a dollar then was still worth holding in your hand That it was necessary did not make it less snotty a job though I dont know whether you have ever skinned a sheep which has lain dead in the rain for a few days but the clammy wet wool adds into the situation the possibility of wool poisoning so that the thought of puffed painful hands accompanies all your handling of the pelt That and a whole lot else on my mind I slit and slit and slit tugging pelt off bloated belly and stiffened legs I started off careful not to work fast in the hope that Canada Dan would slice right along and thereby skin the majority of the carcasses It of course turned out that his strategy was identical and that Canada Dan had had countless more years of practice at being slow than I did In other circumstances I might even have admired the drama in the way he would stop often straighten up to ease what he told me several times was the worlds worst goddamn crick in his back and contemplate my scalpel technique skeptically before finally bending back to his own Out of his experience my father always testified that hed rather work any day with sheepherders than cowboys You might come across a herder thats loony now and then but at least they arent so apt to be such selfinflated sonsabitches Right about now I wondered about that choice If Canada Dan was anywhere near representative sheepherders didnt seem v 109 to bebargains of companionship either Finally I gave up on trying to outslow Canada Dan and went at the skinning quick as I could to get it over with Canada Dans estimate of fifteen dead ewes proved to be eighteen Also I noticed that six of the pelts were branded with a bar above the number signifying that the ewe was a mother of twins Which summed out to the fact that besides the eighteen casualties there were two dozen newly motherless lambs who would weigh light at shipping time This came to Stanleys attention too when he arrived back leading the pack mare and weor rather I because Stanley of course didnt have the hand for it and Canada Dan made no move toward the task whatsoeverslung the first load of pelts onto the pack saddle Guess we know what all that lamb blattings about now observed Stanley Canada Dan didnt seem to hear this either Instead he turned and was trudging rapidly across the slope toward his sheepwagon He whistled the dog from his coat and sent him policing after a few ewes who had dared to stray out onto open grass then yelled back over his shoulder to us Its about belly time Cmon to the wagon when you get those goddamn pelts under control I got us a meal fixed I looked down at my hands and forearms so filthy with blood and other sheep stuff I didnt even want to think about that I hated to touch the reins and saddlehorn to climb onto Pony But climb on I did for it was inevitable as if Biblewritten that now I had to i i llO ride in with Stanley to the sheepwagon unload these wet slimy pelts because he wasnt able ride back out with him for the second batch load them ride back in and unloadseeing it all unfold I abruptly spoke out Stanley Yeah Jick The brown Stetson turned most of the way in my direction All the ways to say what I intended to competed in my mind Stanley This just isnt going to work out stanley this deal was my fathers brainstorm and not mine Im heading down that trail for home Stanley Im not up toto riding herd on you and doing the work of this wampus cat of a sheepherder and maybe getting wool poisoning andBut when my mouth did move I heard it mutter Nothing I guess After wrestling the second consignment of pelts into shelter under Canada Dans sheepwagon I went up by the door to wash Beside the basin on the chopping block lay a sliver of gray soap which proved to be so coarse my skin nearly grated off along with the sheep blood and other mess But I at least felt scoured fairly clean Is there a towel I called into the sheepwagon with what I considered a fine tone of indignation in my voice The upper part of Canada Dan appeared at the dutch door Right rant of your face 11 there in e pointed to a gunny sack hanging from a corner of the wagon Your eyes bad I dried off as best I could on the burlap feeling now as if Id been rasped from elbow to fingertip and swung on into the 111 sheepwagon The table of this wagon was a square of wood about the size of a big checkerboard which pulled out from under the bunk at the far end and then supported by a gate leg which folded down and Stanley had tucked himself onto the seat on one side of our dining site Canada Dan as cook and host I knew would need to be nearest the stove and sit on a stool at the outside end of the table so I slid into the seat opposite Stanley going real careful because three people in a sheepwagon is about twice too many KEEYIPE erupted from under my inmost foot about the same instant my nose caught the distinctive smell of wet dog warming up Here now what the hell kind of manners is that walking on my dog He does that again Rags you want the notion right out of him This must have been Canada Dans idea of hilarity for he laughed a little now in what I considered an eggsucking way Or it may simply have been his pleasure over the meal he had concocted Onto the table the herder plunked a metal plate with a boiled chunk of meat on it then followed that with a stained pan of what looked like small mothballs Like I say I figured you might finally show up today so I fixed you a dukes choice of grub he crowed Get yourselves started with that hominy Then picking up a hefty butcher knife Canada Dan slabbed off a thickness of the grayish greasy meat and toppled it aside wide choice of meat Heres mutton off another slab Or then again heres growedup lamb II i v n oi 112 The butcher knife produced a third plankthick piece Or you can always have sheep meat Canada Dan divvied the slices onto our plates and concluded A menu you dont let just everywhere aint it Yeah Stanley said slower than ever and swallowed experimentally The report crossed my mind that I had just spent a couple of hours elbow deep in dead sheep and now I was being expected to eat some of one but I tried to keep it traveling Time as its said was the essence here The only resource a person has against mutton is to eat it fast before it has a chance for the tallow in it to congeal So I poked mine into me pretty rapidly and even so the last several bites were greasy going Stanley by then wasnt much more than getting started While Canada Dan forked steadily through his meal and Stanley mussed around with his I finished off the hominy on the theory that anything you mixed into the digestive process with mutton was probably all to the good Then I gazed out the dutch door of the sheepwagon while waiting on Stanley The afternoon was going darker a look of corning rain My father more than likely was done by now with the Hahns counting of Walter Kyles and He would be on his way up to the Billy Peak lookout and the big warm dry camp tent there and the company of somebody other than Canada Dan or Stanely Meixell and probably another supper of brookies I hoped devoutly the rain already had started directly onto whatever piece of trail my father might be riding just now 113 Canada Dan meanwhile had rolled himself a cigarette and was filling the wagon with blue smoke while Stanley worked himself toward the halfway point of his slab of mutton Staying the night aint you the herder said more as observation than question You can set up the tepee regular goddamn canvas hotel It only leaks a little where its ripped in that one corner Been meaning to sew the sumbitch up Well actually no said Stanley This perked me up more than anything had in hours Maybe there existed some fingernail of hope for Stanley after all We got all that pack gear to keep dry so well just go on over to that line cabin down on the school section Fact is Stanley here took the chance to shove away his still muttonladen plate and climb onto his feet as if night was stampeding toward himwe better be getting selves over there if were gonna beat dark You ready Jick Was I The line cabin stood just outside the eastern boundary of the Two forest partway back down the mountain We rode more than an hour to get there the weather steadily heavier and grimmer all around us and Stanley fairly grim himself I guess from the mix of alcohol and mutton sludging around beneath his belt Once when I glanced back to be sure I still had him I happened to see him make an awkward lob into the trees that exaggerated higharmed way when you throw with your wrong hand So he had finally r un out of bottle 114 and at least I could look forward to an unpickled companion from here on I hoped he wasnt the kind who came down with the DTs as he dried out Our route angled us down in such a back and forth way that Roman Reef steadily stood above us now on one side now on our other A halfmilehigh stockade of graybrown stone claiming all the sky to the west Even with Stanley and thunderclouds on my mind I made room in there to appreciate the might of Roman Reef Of the peaks and buttresses of the Two generally for as far as Im concerned Montana without its mountain ranges would just be Nebraska stretched north At last ahead of us showed up an orphan outcropping a formation like a crown of rock but about as big as a railroad roundhouse Below it ran the boundary fence and just outside the fence the line cabin About time too because we were getting some first spits of rain and thunder was telling of lightning not all that far off The whole way from Canada Dans sheepwagon Stanley had said never a word nor even glanced ahead any farther than his horses ears Didnt even stir now as we reached the boundary fence of barbwire In a hurry to get us into the cabin before the weather cut loose I hopped off Pony to open the gate My hand was just almost to the top wire hoop when there came a terrific yell GODaMIGHTy get aWAY from that 115 I jumped back as if flung looking crazily around to see what had roused Stanley like this Go find a club and knock the gatewire off with that he instructed You happen to be touching that wire and lightning hits that fence Ill have fried Jick for supper So I humored him went off and found a sizable dead limb of jackpine and tapped the hoop up off the top of the gate stick with it and then used it to fling the gate to one side the way you might flip a big snake The hell of it was I knew Stanley was outandout right A time lightning hit Ed Van Bebbers fence up the South Fork road ig from the English Creek ranger station and the whole top wire melted for about fifty yards in either direction dropping off in little chunks as if itd been minced up by fencing pliers I knew as well as anything not to touch a wire fence in a storm Why then had I damn near done it All I can say in my own defense is that you just try going around with Stanley Meixell on your mind as much as he had been on mine since midmorning and see if you dont do one or another thing dumb I was resigned by now to what was in store for me at the cabin so started in on it right away the unpacking of the mare and Bubbles Already I had size my fathers long bones the example to mine and could do the respected packers trick of reaching all the way across Ehe horses back to lift those offside packs from where I was standing instead of trotting back and forth around the horse all the time I did the mare and then carefully began uncargoing Bubbles Stanley hanging onto the bridle and matter of factly promising Bubbles he would yank v 116 his goddamn spotty head off if the horse gave any trouble Then as I swung the last pack over and off a hefty lift I managed to do without bumping the pack saddle and giving Bubbles an excuse for excitement Stanley pronounced Oh to be young and diddling twice a day again He took noticeof the considerable impact of this on me Scuse my French Jick Its just a saying us old coots have Nonetheless it echoed around in me as I lugged the packs through the cabin door and stood them in a corner By now thunder was applauding lightning below us as well as above and the rain was arriving in earnest my last couple of trips outside considerably damp Stanley meanwhile was trying to inspire a fire in the rickety stove The accumulated chill in the cabin had us both shivering as we lit a kerosene lantern and waited for the stove to produce some result Feels in here like itts gonna frost I muttered Yeah u Stanley agreed ttAbout six inches deep That delivered me a thought I didnt particularly want What ah what if this turns to snow I could see myself blizzarded in here for a week with this reprobate Aw I dont imagine it will Lightning like this its probably just a thunderstorm Stanley contemplated the rain spatting onto the cabin window and evidently was reminded that his pronouncement came close to being good news Still he amended you never know The cabin was not much of a layout Simply a roofedover bin of i an 117 maybe fifteen feet long and ten wide and with a single window beside the door at the south end But at least itd be drier than outside Outside in fact was showing every sign of anticipating a nightlong bath The face of the Rocky Mountains gets more weather than any other place I know of and a person just has to abide by that fact mostly I considered the small stash of wood behind the kindling and headed back out for enough armfuls for the night and morning Off along the tree line I found plenty of squaw wood which already looked soused from the rain but luckily snapped okay when I tromped it in half over a log With that provisioning done and a bucket of water lugged from a seep of spring about seventy yards out along the slope I declared myself in for the evening and shed my wet slicker Stanley through all this stayed halfpropped halfsitting on an end of the little plank table Casual as a man waiting for eternity His stillness set me to wondering Wondering just how much whiskey was in him After all hed been like a mummy on the ride from Canada Dans camp too And so before too awful long I angled across the room as if exercising the saddle hours out of my legs for a closer peek at him At first I wasnt enlightened by what I saw The crowfoot lines at the corners of Stanleys eyes were showing deep and sharp as if he was squinched up to study closely at something and he seemed washedout whitish across that part of his face too Like any Ivan D i 118 Montana kid I had seen my share of swackedup people yet Stanley didnt really look liquored No he looked more likeHows that hand of yours I inquired putting m y suspicion as lightly as I knew how Stanley roused Feels like its been places He moved his gaze past me and around the cabin interior Not so bad quarters Not much worse than I remember this pack rat palace anyway Maybe we ought to have a look I persisted That wrappings seen better times Before he could waltz off onto some other topic I stepped over to him and began to untie the rustcolored wrapping When I unwound that fabric the story was gore The back of Stanleys hand between the first and last knuckles was skinned raw where the sharp edge of Bubbles hoof had shoved off skin raw and seepy and butcheredlooking Jesus H Christ I breathed Aw could be worse Even as he said so though Stanley seemed more pale and eroded around the eyes Ill get it looked at when 1 get to town Theres some bag balm in my saddlebag there Get the lid off that for me will you and Ill dab some on Stanley slathered the balm thick across the back of his hand and I stepped over again and began to rewrap it for him He noticed that the wrapping was not the bloodstained handkerchief Whered you come up with that The tail off my shirt Your mas gonna like to find that 119 I shrugged Trouble was lined up deep enough here in company with Stanley that my mothers turn at it seemed a long way off Feels like new Stanley tried to assure me moving his bandaged hand with a flinch he didnt want to show and I didnt really want to see What if he passed out on me What if1 tried to think of anything I had ever heard about blood poisoning and gangrene Supposedly those took a while to develop But then this stint of mine with Stanley was beginning to seem like a while I figured it was time to try get Stanleys mind not to say my own off his wound and to bring up what I considered was a natural topic So I queried What are we going to do about supper Stanley peered at me a considerable time Then said I seem to distinctly remember Canada Dan feeding us That was a while back I defended Sort of a second lunch Stanley shook his head a bit and voted himself out I dont just feel like anything right now You go ahead So now things had reached the point where I had lost out even on my fathers scattershot version of cooking and was going to have to invent my own I held another considerable mental conversation with US forest ranger Varick McCaskill about that meanwhile fighting the stove to get any real heat from it At last I managed to warm a can of provisions I dug out of one of the packs of groceries for the herders and exploring further I came up with bread and some promising sandwich material 120 An imminent meal is my notion of a snug fortune I was even humming the Pancho and Sancho and Suzy tune when ready to dine I sat myself down across the table from Stanley He looked a little quizzical then drew in a deep sniff Then queried Is that menu of yours what I think it is Huh Just pork and beans and an onion sandwich Why Never mind i Canada Dans cooking must have stuck with me more than I was aware though as I didnt even think to open any canned fruit for dessert Meanwhile the weather was growing steadily more rambunctious Along those mountainsides thunder can roll and roll and constant claps were arriving to us now like beer barrels tumbling down stairs Now an electrical storm is not something I am fond of And here along the east face of the Rockies any of these big rock thrusts such as that crown outcropping up the slope from the cabin notoriously can draw down lightning bolts In fact the more I pondered that outcropping the less comfortable I became with the fact that it neighbored us In my head I always counted the miles to how far away the lightning had hitsomething I still find myself when the next bolt winked somewhere out the south window I began the formula One athousand Two athousand Three The boom reached us then the bolt had struck just more than two miles off That could be worse and likely would be an o 121 Meanwhile rain was raking the cabin We could hear it drum against the west wall as well as on the board roof Sounds like we got a dewy night ahead of us Stanley offered He looked a little perkier now for whatever reason Myself I was beginning to droop the day catching up with me I did some more counting whenever I happened to glimpse a crackle of light out the window but came up with pretty much the same mileage each time and so began to lose attention toward that Putting this day out of its misery seemed a better and better idea The cabin didnt have any beds as such just a cobbledtogether double bunk arrangement with planks where youd like a mattress to be But any place to be prostrate looked welcome and I got up from the table to untie my bedroll from behind my saddle and spread it onto the upper planks The sky split white outside the cabin That crack of thunder I honestly felt as much as heard A jolt through the air as if a quake had leapt upward out of the earth I believe my hair was swept straight on end from that blast of noise and light I know I had trouble getting air into my body past the blackade where my heart was trying to climb out my throat Stanley though didntt show any particular ruffle at all The quick hand of God my ma used to say well I informed him when 1 found the breath for it Id just as soon it grabbed around someplace else I stood waiting for the next cataclysm although what really was 122 on my mind was the saying that youll never hear the lightning bolt that hits you The rain rattled constantly loud now At last there came a big crackling sound quite a way off and while I knew nature is not that regular I told myself the lightning portion of the storm had moved beyond if it hadnt I might as well be dead in bed as anywhere elseand I announced to Stanley Im turning in What already uYeah alreadya word which for some reason annoyed me as much as anything had all day Leaning over to unlace my forester boots a hightopped old pair of my fathers I had grown into I fully felt how much the day had fagged me The laces were a downright chore But once my boots and socks were off 1 indulged in a promising yawn pulled out what was left of my shirt tail and swung myself into the upper bunk Guess Im more foresighted than I knew I heard Stanley go on to bring Doctor Hall along for company Who I asked my eyes open again at this Gros Ventres physician was Doc Spence and I knew he was nowhere near our vicinity Stanley lanked himself up and casually went over to the packs uDoctor Hall he repeated as he brought out his good hand from a pack a brown bottle of whiskey in it Doctor Al K Hall u The weather of the night I suppose continued in commotion But at that age I could have slept through a piano tuners convention Came morning I was up and around while Stanley still lay flopped in the lower bunk 123 First thing I made a beeline to the window No snow Not only was I saved from being wintered in with Stanley but Roman Reef and all the peaks south beyond it stood in sun as if the little square of window had been made into a summer picture of the Alps It still floors me how the mountains are not the same any two days in a row As if hundreds of copies of those mountains exist and each dawn brings in a fresh one of new color new prominence of some feature over the others a different wrapping of cloud or rinse of sun for this days version I lit a fire and went out to check on the horses and brought in a pail of fresh water and even then Stanley hadnt budged just was breathing like hed decided on hibernation The bottle which had nursed him into that condition I noticed was down by about a third Telling myself Stanley could starve to death in bed for all I cared I fashioned breakfast for myself heating up a can of peas and more or less toasting some slices of bread by holding them over the open stove on a fork Eventually Stanley did join the day As he worked at getting his boots on I gave him some secret scrutiny I couldnt see though that he assayed much better or worse than the night before Maybe he just looked that way sort of absentmindedly pained all the time I offered to heat up some breakfast peas for him but he said no thanks anyway At last Stanley seemed ready for camptending again and I figured it was time to broach what was heaviest on my mind The calendar of our continued companionship 124 How longs this going to take do you think Well you seen what we got into yesterday with Canada Dan Herders have always got their own quantities of trouble Stanley could be seen sheepherders to be calculating either the trouble capacities of our next two or the extent of my impatience I suppose we better figure itll take most of a day apiece for this pair too Two more days of messing with herders then the big part of another day to ride back to English Creek It loomed before me like a career What about if we split up I suggested as if I was naturally businesslike Each tend one herders camp today Stanley considered some more You would have thought he was doing it in Latin the time it took him But finally I dont see offhand why that wouldnt work You know this piece of country pretty good Take along the windchester meaning his rifle If any bear starts eating on me hell pretty soon give up on account of gristle some more to see whether anything further was going to mind but nothing did So yeah We got it to do might yayhoo as well get at it Which you want Gufferson or Sanford Hebner 1 thought on that Sanford was in his second or third summer in these mountains Maybe he had entirely outgrown the highcountry whimwhams of the sort Canada Dan was showing and maybe he hadnt Andy Gustaf son on the other hand was a longtimer in the Two country and probably had been given the range between Canada Dan and Sanford 125 for the reason that he was savvy enough not to let the bands of sheep get mixed I was more than ready to be around somebody with savvy for a change Ill take Andy Okeydoke I guess you know where he is in west of here about under the middle of Roman Reef Lets go see sheepherders Outside in the wet morning I discovered the possible drawback to my choice which was that Andy Gustafsons camp supplies were in the pack rig that went on Bubbles That bothered me some but when I pictured Stanley and his hamburgered hand trying to cope with Bubbles for a day I figured it fell to me to handle the knothead anyway At least in my fathers universe matters fell that way So I worked the packs onto the black mare for Stanleyshe was so tame she all but sang encouragement while the load was going on herand then faced the nosed nemesis But Bubbles seemed not particularly more snorty and treacherous than usual and with Stanley taking a lefthanded death grip on the bridle again and addressing a steady stream of threats into the horses ear and with me staying well clear of hooves while getting the packsacks roped on we had Bubbles loaded in surprisingly good time See you back here for beans Stanley said and as he reined toward Sanfords camp Pony and I headed west up the mountain Bubbles grudgingly behind us I suppose now hardly anybody knows that horseback way of life on a trail I have always thought that horseback is the ideal way to see 126 country if you just didnt have to deal with the damn horse and one thing to be said for Pony was that she was so gentle and steady you could almost forget she was down there As for the trail itselfeven in the situation I 7as in this scene was one to store away Pointed west as I was the horizon of the Rockies extended wider than my vision To take in the total of peaks I had to move my head as far as I could to either side It never could be said that this country of the Two didnt offer enough elbow room For that matter shinbone and cranium and all other kind too Try as you might to be casual about a ride up from English Creek into these mountains you were doing something sizable Climbing from the front porch of the planet into its attic so to speak Before long I could look back out onto the plains and see the blue dab of Lake Frances and the water tower of Valier on its east shorewhat would that be thirty miles away thirtyfive About half as far off was the bulge of trees which marked where the town of Gros Ventre sat in the long procession of English Greeks bankside cottonwoods and willows Gros Ventre pronounced GROVE on in that frontend way that town names of French origin get handled in Montana making Choteau SHOW toh and Havre HAV er and Wibaux WEE boh Nothing entertained residents of Gros Ventre more than hearing some tourist or other outlander pop out with gross ventree My father though figured that the joke was also on the town Not a whole hell of a lot of them know that Gros Ventres the French for Big Belly Of course where all this started is that Gros Ventre is the name of an Indian tribe although not what 127 might be called a local one The Gros Ventres originally before Reservation days were up in the Milk River country near the Canadian line Why a place down here picked up that tribes name I didnt really know Toussaint Rennie was the one who knew A to Why about the Two country Sometime I would have to ask him this name question Distant yet familiar sites offering themselves above and below me and a morning when I was on my own Atop my own horse and leading a beast of burden even if the one was shortlegged and pudgY and the definitely Justified the term of beast Entrusted with a Winchester 3006 not that I ever was one to look forward to shooting it out with a bear A day to stand the others up against this one The twin feelings of aloneness and freedom seemed to lift and lift me send me up over the landscape like a balloon Of course I know it was the steady climb of the land itself that created that impression But whatever was responsible I was glad enough to accept such soaring Quite possibly I ought to think about this as a way of life I by now was telling myself By which I didnt mean chaperoning Stanley Meixell One round of that likely was enough for a lifetime But packing like this running a packstring as Isidor Pronovost did for my fatherthat was worth spending some daydreams on Yes definitely a packers career held appeal Be your own boss out on the trail Fresh air exercise scenery Adventure One of the stories my father told oftenest was of being with Isidor on one of the really high trails farthest back in these mountains of the Two where a misstep by one horse or mule might pull all the rest into a tumble a few thousand feet 128 down the slope when Isidor turned in his saddle and conversationally said Mac if we was to roll this packstring right about here the buggersd bounce till they stunk Maybe a quieter mountain job than packing Forest fire lookout up there in one of Franklin Delanos lighthouses Serene as a hermit a person could spend summers in a lookout cabin atop the Two Peer around like a human hawk for smoke Heroic work Fresh air scenery some codger like Stanley to fetch your groceries up the mountainside to you The new Billy Peak lookout might be the prime job Id be finding that out right now if my father hadnt detoured me into conpanioning damn old Stanley Well next year next counting tripUp and up I and my horses and my dreams went toward the angle of slope beneath the center of Roman Reef Eventually a considerable sidehill of timber took the trail from sight and before Pony and Bubbles and I entered the stand of trees I whoaed us for a last gaze along all the mountains above and around They were the sort of thing you would have if every cathedral in the world were lined up along the horizon Not much ensued for the first minutes of the forested trail just a sharpening climb and the route beginning to kink into a series of switchbacks Sunbeams were threaded down through the pine branches and with that dappled light I didnt even mind being in out of the view for the next little while A forests look of being everlasting is an illusion Trees too are mortal and they come down I was about to face one such In the middle of a straight tilt of trail between switchbacks there lay a fresh downed 129 lodgepole pine poking out over my route just above the height of a horse On one of my fathers doctrines of mountain travel I had a light little cruising ax along with me But the steep hillside made an awkward place to try any chopping and what I didnt have was a saw of any sort Besides I was in no real mood to do trail maintenance for my father and the United States Forest Service I studied the toppled lodgepole It barriered the trail to me in the saddle but there was just room enough for a riderless horse to pass beneath All I needed to do was get off and lead Pony and Bubbles through But given the disposition of Bubbles I knew Id damn well better do it a horse at a time I tied Bubbles lead rope to a middlesized pinedoubling the square knot just to be sureand led Pony up the trail beyond the windfall Be right back with that other crowbait I assured her as I looped her reins around the leftover limb of a stump Bubbles was standing with his neck in the one position he seemed to know for it stretched out like he was being towed and I had to haul hard on his lead rope for enough slack to untie my knots Come on churnhead I said as civilly as I couldBubbles was not too popular with me anyway because if he originally hadnt kicked Stanley I wouldnt have been in the camptending messand with some tugging persuaded him into motion Bubbles didnt like the prospect of the downed tree when we got there I could see his eyes fixed on the shaggy crown limbs overhead and 130 his ears lay back a little But one thing about Bubbles he didnt lead much harder when he was being reluctant than when he wasnt I suppose it can be said that I flubbed the dub on all this That the whole works came about as the result of my reluctance to clamber up that sidehill and do axwork Yet answer me this was I the first person not to do what I didnt want to Nor was goddamn Bubbles blameless now was he After all I had him most of the way past the windfall before he somehow managed to swing his hindquarters too close in against the hillside where he inevitably brushed against a broken branch dangling down from the tree trunk Even that wouldnt have set things off except for the branch whisking in across the front of his left hip toward his crotch Bubbles went straight sideways off the mountain He of course took the lead rope with him and me at the end of it like a kite on a string I cant say how far downslope I flew but I was in the air long enough to get good and worried Plummeting sideways as well as down is unnerving your body trying to figure out how to travel in those two directions at once And a surprising number of thoughts fan out in your mind such as whether you are most likely to come down on top of or under the horse below you and which part of you you can best afford to have broken and how long before a search party and why you ever in the first placeI landed more or less upright though Upright and being towed down the slope of the mountain in giant galloping strides sinking about shindeep every time the dirt so softened by all the rain 131 After maybe a dozen of those plowing footfalls my journey ended Horse nostrils could be heard working overtime nearby me and I discovered the lead rope still was taut in my hand as if the plunge off the trail had frozen it straight out like a long icicle What I saw first though was not Bubbles but Pony A horses eyes are big Terraplane anyway but I swear Ponys were the size of headlights as she peered down over the rim of the trail at Bubbles and me all the way below Easy girl I called up to her All I needed next was for Pony to get excited jerk her reins loose from that stump and quit the country leaving me down here with this tangledup packhorse Easy Pony Easy there Everythings gonna bejust goddamn dandy Sure it was On my first individual outing I had rolled the packstring even if it was only one inveterate jughead of a horse named Bubbles Great wonderful work campjack McCaskill Keep on in this brilliant fashion and you maybe someday can hope to work your way up to moron Now I had to try to sort out the situation A little below me on the sidehill Bubbles was floundering around a little and snorting a series of alarms The favorable part of that was that he was up on his feet Not only up but showing a greater total of vigor than he had during the whole pack trip so far So Bubbles was in one piece I seemed to be intact and the main damage I could see on the packs was a short gash in the canvas where something snagged it on our way down Sugar or salt was trickling from there but it looked 132 as if I could move a crossrope over enough to pinch the hole shut I delivered Bubbles a sound general cussing meanwhile working along the lead rope until I could grab his halter and then reach his neck From there I began to pat my way back being sure to make my cussing sound a little more soothing to get to the ruptured spot on the pack When I put my hand onto the crossrope to tug it across the gash the pack moved a bit I tugged again in a testing way and all the load on Bubbles back moved a bit Son of a goddamn sonofabitch I remember was all I managed to come out with to commemorate this discovery That wasnt too bad under the circumstance for the situation called for either hard language or hot tears and maybe it could be pinpointed that right there I grew out of the bawling age into the cussing one Bubbles downhill excursion had broken the lash cinch the one that holds the packs into place on a horses back So I had a packhorse whole and healthyand my emotions about Bubbles having survived in good fettle were now getting radically mixedbut no way to secure his load onto him I was going to have to ride somewhere for a new cinch or at the very least to get this one repaired Choices about like Canada Dans menu of mutton or sheep meat those Stanley by now was miles away at Sanford Hebners camp Besides with his hand and his thirst both the way they were I wasnt sure how much of a repairer he would prove to be anyway Or I could climb on Pony 133 head back down the trail all the way to the English Creek station and tell that father of mine to come mend the fix hed pitched me into This second notion held appeal of numerous kinds I would be rid of Stanley and responsibility for him Id done all I could in no way was it my fault that Bubbles had schottisched off a mountaintop Most of all delivering my predicament home to English Creek would serve my father right He was the instigator of all this who better to haul himself up here and contend with the mess CaJne Yet when I down to it I was bothered by the principle of anyone venturing to my rescue I could offer all the alibis this side of Halifax but the truth of it still stood Somebody besides myself would be fishing me out of trouble Here was yet another consequence of my damned inbetween age I totally did not want to be in the hell of a fix I Yet somehow I just as much did not relish resorting to anybody else to pluck me out of it Have you ever been deadcentered that way Hung between two schools of thought neither one of which you wanted to give in to Why the human mind doesnt positively split in half in such a situation I dont know As I was pondering back and forth that way I happened to rub my forehead with the back of my free hand It left moisture above my brow Damn One more sign of my predicament real trouble always makes the backs of my hands sweat I suppose nerves cause it Whatever does it spooks a person to have his hands sweating their own worry like that Thats just about enough of all this I said out loud apparently to Pony and Bubbles and maybe to my sweating hands and the mountainside 134 and I suppose out across the air toward Stanley Meixell and Varick McCaskill as well And to myself too For some part of my mind had spurned the backandforth debate of whether to go fetch Stanley or dump the situation in my fathers lap and instead got to wondering There ought to be some way in this world to contrive that damn cinch back together If youre going to get by in the Forest Service you better be able to fix anything but the break of day my father said every spring when he set in to re the English Creek equipment Not that I was keen on taking him as an example just then butNo hope came out of my search of Bubbles and the packs Any kind of thong or spare leather was absent The saddlestrings on my saddle up there where Pony was I did think of but couldnt figure how to let go of Bubbles while I went to get them Having taken up mountaineering so passionately there was no telling where Bubbles would crash off to if I wasnt here to hang onto him I started looking myself over for possibilities Hat coat shirt no help Belt though I hated to think of it I maybe could cut that up into leather strips Yet would they be long enough if I better down there my forester boots a bootlace a bootlace just by God might do the trick By taking a wrap of Bubbles lead rope around the palm of my left hand I was more or less able to use thethumb and fingers to grasp the lash cinch while I punched holes in it with my jackknife All the while of course talking sweetly to Bubbles When I had a set 135 of holes accomplished on either side of the break I threaded the bootlace back and forth back and forth and at last tied it to make a splice Then Bubbles recent standard of behavior uppermost in my mind I made one more set of holes farther along each part of the cinch and wove in the remainder of the bootlace as a second splice for insurance In a situation like this you had better do things the way youre supposed to do them I now had a boot gaping open like an unbuckled overshoe but the lash cinch looked as if it ought to lift a boxcar Now there remained only the matter of negotiating Bubbles back up to where he had launched from Talk about an uphill job But as goddamn Stanley wouldve observed to me I had it to do Probably the ensuing ruckus amounted to only about twenty minutes of fightanddrag though it seemed hours Right then you could not have sold me all the packhorses on the planet for a nickel Bubbles would take a step and balk Balk and take a step Fright or exasperation or obstinance or whatever other mood can produce it had him dryfarting like the taster in a popcorn factory Try to yank me back down the slope Balk again and let himself slide back down the slope a little Sneeze then fart another series Shake the packs in hope the splice would let go Start over on the balking I at last somehow worked his head up level with the trail and then simply leaned back on the lead rope until Bubbles exhausted his various acts and had to glance around at where he was When the sight of the trail registered in his tiny mind he pranced on up as if it was 136 his own idea all along I sat for awhile to recover my breathafter tying Bubbles to the biggest tree around with a triple square knotand sort of take stock The pulling contest definitely had taken all the jingle out of me Theres this to be said for exertion though It does send your blood tickling through your brain When I was through resting I directly went over to Bubbles addressed him profanely thrust an arm into the pack with the canned goods and pulled cans out until I found the ones of tomatoes If I ever did manage to get this menagerie to Andy Gustafsons sheep camp I was going to be able to say truthfully that Id had lunch and did not need feeding by one more sheepherder I sat back down opened two cans with my jackknife and imbibed tomatoes One thing about canned tomatoes my father had the habit of saying during a trail meal if youre thirsty you can drink them and if youre hungry you can eat them Maybe I conceded he was right about that one thing By the time I reached Andy Gustafsons camp my neck was thoroughly cricked from the constant looking back over my shoulder to see if the packs were staying on Bubbles They never shifted though Thank God for whoever invented bootlaces Andys band was spread in nice fashion along both sides of a timbered draw right under the cliff of Roman Reef If you have the courage to let themmore of it say than was possessed by a certain bozo named Canada Dansheep will scatter themselves into a slow 137 comfortable graze even in upanddown country But it takes a herder who is sure of himself and has a sort of sixth sense against coyotes and bear I was greeted by a little stampede of about a dozen lambs toward me They are absentminded creatures and sometimes will glance up and run to the first moving thing they see which was the case with these now When they figured out that Pony and Bubbles and I were not their mommas they halted peered at us a bit then rampaged off in a new direction Nothing is more likeable than a lamb bucking in fun First will come that waggle of the tail a spasm of wriggles faster than the eye can follow Then a stifflegged jump sideways the current of joy hitting the little body so quick there isnt time to bend its knees Probably a bleat byeahhh next and then the romping run Watching them you have to keep reminding yourself that lambs grow up and what is pleasantly foolish in a lambs brain is going to linger on to be just dumbness in the mind of a fullsize ewe Andy Gustafson had no trove of dead camased ewes nor any particular complaints nor even much to say He was wrinkled up in puzzlement for awhile as to why it was me that was tending his camp even after I explained as best I could and I saw some speculation again when he noticed me slopping along with one boot unlaced But once hed checked through the groceries Id brought to make sure that a big can of coffee and some tins of sardines were in there and his weekly newspaper as wellNorwegian sheepherders seemed to come in two varieties those whose acquaintance with the alphabet stopped stubbornly with the X they used for a signature and those who would 138 quit you in an instant if you ever forgot to bring their mail copy of Nordiske TidendeAndy seemed perfectly satisfied He handed me his list of personals for the next camptendingrazor blades a pair of socks Copenhagen snooseand away I went Where a day goes in the mountains I dont know but by the time I reached the cabin again the afternoon was almost done Stanleys saddle sorrel and the black packhorse were picketed a little way off and Stanley emerged to offer me as usual whatever lefthanded help he could manage in unsaddling Bubbles He noticed the spliced cinch See you had to use a little wildwood glue on the outfit I grunted something or other to that and Standley seemed to divine that it was not a topic I cared to dwell on He switched to a question Hows old Gufferson He said about three words total I wouldnt exactly call that bellyaching This sounded pretty tart even to me so I added And he had his sheep in a nice Wyoming scatter there west of his wagon Sanfords on top of things too Stanley reported Hasnt lost any and his lambs are looking just real good Plain as anything then there was one sore thumb up here on the Busbys allotment and it went by the name of Canada Stanley extended Looks like Dans asking for a ticket to town 139 This I didnt follow In all the range ritual I knew and even in the perpetual wrestle between Dode Withrow and Pat Hoy the herder always was angling to provoke a reason for quitting not to be fired Being fired from any job was a taint a neversought smudge True Canada Dan was a prime example that even God gets careless butThe puzzle pursued me on into the cabin As Stanley stepped to the stove to try rev the fire a little I asked What are you saying Canada Dan wants to get himself canned Looks like It can happen that way A manll get into a situation and do what he can to make it worse so hell get chucked out of it My own guess is Dans feeling thirsty and is scared of this timber as well but he dont want to admit either one to himself Easier to lay blame onto somebody else Stanley paused Question is whether to try disappoint him out of the idea or just go ahead and can him Another season of I will thought Then Canada Dan is not such a helluva human being that I want to put up with an entire summer of his guff This was a starchier Stanley than I had yet seen This one you could imagine giving Canada Dan the reaming out he so richly deserved The flash of backbone didnt last long though But I guess hes the Busby boys decision not mine Naturally the day was too far gone for us to ride home to English Creek so I embarked on the chores of wood and water again at least salving myself with the prospect that tomorrow I would be relieved of Stanley We would rise in the morningand I intended it would be an early rise indeedand ride down out of here and I would resume my 140 summer at the English Creek ranger station and Stanley would sashay on past to the Busby brothers ranch and that would be that When I stumped in with the water pail that unlaced left boot of mine all but flapping in the breeze I saw Stanley study the situation Too bad we cant slice up Bubbles for bootlaces he offered Thatd help I answered shortly I never like to tell anybody how to wear his boots But if it was me now I waited while Stanley paused to speculate out the cabin window to where dusk was beginning to deepen the gray of the cliff of Roman Reef But I wasnt in any mood for very damn much waiting You were telling me all about boots I prompted kind of sarcastically Yeah Well If it was me now Id take that one shoestring you got there and cut it in half and lace up each boot with a piece as far as itll go Ought to keep them from slopping off your feet anyhow Worth a try Anything was I went ahead and did the halving and the boots then laced firm as far as my insteps The high tops pooched out like funnels but at least now I could get around without one boot always threatening to leave me One chore remained I reached around and pulled my shirt up out of the back of my pants The remainder of the tail of it I jackknifed off Stanleys hand didnt look quite so hideous this time when I rewrapped it in the high dry air of the Two cuts heal faster than can be believed But this paw of Stanleys still was no prize winner o 141 Well Stanley announced now you got me nursed Seems like the next thing ought to be a call on the doctor And almost before he was through saying it last nights bottle reappeared over the table its neck tilted into Stanleys cup Before Stanley got too deep into his oil of joy there was one more vital point I wanted tended to Diplomatically I began Suppose maybe we ought to give some thoughtto supper Stanley finished for me as he dippered a little water into his prescription I had something when I got back from Sanfords camp But you go ahead I at least knew by now I could be my own chef if I had to and I stepped over to the packs to get started There a harsh new light dawned on me Now that we had tended the camps the packs were empty of groceries which meant that weor at least I because so far I had no evidence that Stanley ever required foodwere at the mercy of whatever was on hand in Stanleys own small supply pack Apprehensively I dug around in there but all that I came up with that showed any promise was an aging loaf of bread and some Velveeta cheese So I made myself a bunch of sandwiches out of those and mentally chalked up one more charge against my father When Id finished it still was only twilight and Stanley just had applied the bottle and dipper to the cup for a second time Oh it looked like another exquisite evening ahead all right A regular night at the opera 142 Right then though a major idea came to me I cleared my throat to make way for the words of it Then I believe maybe Ill have me one too Stanley had put his cup down on the table but was resting his good hand over the top of it as if there was a chance it might hop away One what One of thosedoctor visits A swig This drew me a considerable look from Stanley He let go of his cup and scraftched an ear Just how old re you Fifteen I maintained borrowing the next few months Stanley did some more considering but by now I was figuring out that if he didnt say no right off the bat chances were he wouldnt get around to saying it at all At last Got to wet your wick sometime I guess Cant see how a swallow or two can hurt you He transferred the bottle to a place on the table nearer me Copying his style of pouring I tilted the cup somewhat at the same time I was tipping the bottle Just before I thought Stanley might open his mouth to say something I ended the flow Then went over to the water bucket and dippered in a splash or so the way he had It is just remarkable how something you werent aware of knowing can pop to your aid at the right moment From times I had been in the Medicine Lodge saloon with my father I was able to offer now in natural salute to Stanley Heres how How Stanley recited back automatically 143 Evidently I swigged somewhat deeper than I intended Or should have gone a little heavier on the splash of water Or something By the time I set my cup down on the board table I was blinking hard While I was at this Stanley meanwhile had got up to shove wood into the stove So what do you think he inquired Will it ever replace water I didnt know about that but the elixir of Doctor Hall did draw a persons attention Stanley reseated himself and was gandering around the room again Whos our landlord do you know Huh This cabin Whos got this school section now Oh The Double w Jesus H Christ Accompanying this from Stanley was the strongest look he had yet given me When scrutiny told him I was offering an innocents truth he let out Is there a blade of grass anywhere those sonuvabitches wont try to get their hands on I dunno Did you have some runin with the Double W too A runin Stanley considered the weight of the words You might call it that I guess I had the particular pleasure once of telling old Warren Williamson Wendells daddy that that big belly of his was a tombstone for his dead ass Scuse my French again And some other stuff got said Stanley sipped and reflected What did you mean too 1 11 My brother Alec hes riding for the Double W 144 The hell you say Stanley waited for me to go on and when I didnt he provided I wouldnt wish that onto nobody But just how does it constitute a runin My folks I elaborated Theyre plenty pis uh peed off over it Family feathers in a fluff The old old story Stanley tipped a sip again and I followed Inspirationinacup must have been the encouragement my tongue was seeking for before long I heard myself asking You havent been in the Two country the last while have you Naw Where you been Oh just a lot of places Stanley seemed to review them on the cabin wall Down in Colorado for awhile Talk about dry Half that state was blowing around chasing after the other half A little time in both Dakotas Worked in the wheat harvest there insofar as there was any wheat after the drouth and the grasshoppers And Wyoming I was an association rider in that Gady country a summer or two Then Montana here again for a while over in the Big Hole Basin A couple of haying seasons there He considered summed Around Which moved him to another drag from his cup I had one from mine too Whatre you doing back up in this country Like I say by now I been every place else and theyre no better Came back to the everloving Two to take up a career in tending camp as you can plainly see They advertise in those big newspapers for 145 onehanded raggedy ass camptenders dont you know You bet they do He did seem a trifle sensitive on this topic Well there was always some other such as the matter of who he had been before he became a wandering comet Are you from around here originally Not hardly Not a Two Mediciner by birth He glanced at me Like you No I Stanley Meixell originated in Missouri on a farm east of St Joe in Daviess County As he told it the summer he turned thirteen he encountered the downrow of cornthat tumbled line of cornstalks knocked over by the harvest wagon as it straddled its way through the field Custom was that the youngest of the crew always had to be the picker of the downrow and Stanley was the last of five Meixell boys Ahead of him stretched a green gauntlet of downrow summers Except that by the end of the first sweltering day of stooping and ferreting into the tangle of downed stalks for ears of corn Stanley came to his decision about further Missouri life Within the week I was headed out to the Kansas high plains If youre like me you think of Kansas as one eternal wheatf ield but actually western Kansas then was cattle country Dodge City was out there after all Four or five years of ranch jobs out there in jayhawk country ensued for Stanley I can tell you a little story on that Jick This once we were dehorning a bunch of Texas steers There was this one ornery sonuvabitch of a buckskin steer we never could get corraled with the others After enough of trying hed pay five dollars to anybody whod bring that sonuvabitching steer in Well 146 dont you know another snotnose kid and me decided wed just be the ones Off we rode and we come onto him about three miles away from the corral all by hisself and he wasnt about to be driven Well then we figured wed just rope him and drag him in We got to thinking thoughthree miles is quite a drag aint it So instead we each loosed out our lariat about ten feet of it and took turns to get out in front of him and pop him across the nose with that rope When we done that hed make a hell of a big run at us and wed dodge ahead out of his way and he choused us back toward the corral thatway We finally got him up within about a quarter of a mile of the dehorning Then each of us roped an end and tied him down and went on into the ranch and hitched up a stoneboat and loaded him on and boated him in in high old style The foreman was waiting for us with five silver dollars in his hand Cowboying in the high old style Alec I thought to myself youre the one who ought to be hearing this As happens Stanleys life history went on something came along to dislodge him from that cowboying life It was a long bunkhouse winter weather just bad enough to keep him cooped on the ranch Id go give the cows a jag of hay two times a day and otherwise all there was to do was sit around and do hairwork Each time Stanley was in the barn he would pluck strands from the horses tails then back he went beside the bunkhouse stove to braid horsehair quirts and bridles and eventually even a whole damn lasso By the end of that hairwork winter the tails of the horses had thinned drastically and so had Stanleys patience with Kansas 147 All this I found amazingly interesting I suppose that part of my father was duplicated in me the fascination about pawing over old times While Stanley was storying my cup had drained itself without my really noticing Thus when he stopped to tip another round into his cup I followed suit The whiskey was weaving a little bit of wooze around me so I was particularly pleased that I was able to dredge back yet another Medicine Lodge toast I offered it heartily Heres lead in your pencil That one made Stanley eye me sharply for a moment but he said only as he had the first time how and tipped his cup Well thats Missouri and Kansas accounted for I chirped in encouragement How was it you got up here to Montana On the 17th of March of 1898 to be real exact Stanley boarded the first train of his life From someone he had heard about Montana and a goahead new town called Kalispell which is over on the west side of the Rockies about straight across from there in the cabin where Stanley was telling me all this Two days and two nights on that train The shoebox full of fried chicken one of those Kansas girls fixed for me didnt quite last the trip through In Kalispell then you could hear hammers going all over town For the next few years Stanley grew up with the community He worked sawmill jobs driving a sawdust cart sawfiling foremanning a lumber piling crew Went out on some jobs with the US Geological Survey for a while there A winter he worked as a teamster hauling lumber 148 from Lake Blaine into Kalispell Another spell he even was a river pig during one of the log drives on the north fork of the Flathead River It was a world of timber over there then I tell you something though Jick People kind of got spoiled by it Take those December of my first year in Kalispell They burned along the whole damn mountains from Big Fork to Bad Rock Canyon and even farther north than that Everybody went out on the hills east of town at night to see the fire Running wild on the mountains that way Green kid I was I asked why somebody didnt do something about it Thats public domain I got told Belongs to the government not nobody around here Damn it to hell though when I saw that forest being burned up it just never seemed right to me Stanley here took stiff encouragement from his cup as if quenching the distaste for forest fire Damn fire anyhow I seconded with a slurp of my own But what got you across the mountains here to the Two Stanley gave me quite a glance I guess to estimate the state of my health under Dr Halls ministration I felt firstrate and blinked Stanley an earnest response that was meant to say so Better go a little slow on how often you visit that cup he advised Then The Two Medicine country Why did I ever kiss her hello Good question One of the best What ensued is somewhat difficult to reconstruct The bald truth I may as well say is that as Stanley waxed forth my sobriety waned But even if I had stayed sharpeared as a deacon the headful of the past which Stanley now provided me simply was too much to keep straight 149 Tale upon tale of the Two country memories of how the range looked some certain year people who had passed away before I was born English Creek Noon Creek Gros Ventre the Reservation names of horses habits of sheepherders and cowboys appreciations of certain saloons and tenders I was accustomed to a broth of history from my father and Toussaint Rennie some single topic at a time but Stanleys version was a brimming mulligan stew I can tell you a time Jick I was riding along in here under the Reef and met an old Scotch sheepherder on his horse Whitebearded geezer hadnt had a haircut since Christmas Lad he calls out to me Can ye tell me the elevation here where we are Not offhand I say to him why does he want to know Ye see I was right here when those surveyors of that Theological Survey come through years ago and they told me the elevation but I forgot Im pretty sure the number had a 7 in it though The forest fires of 1910 which darkened daytime for weeks on end Stanley helped combat the stubborn one in the Two mountains west of where Swift Dam now stood The flu epidemic during the world war he remembered death outrunning the hearse capacity two and three coffins at a time in the back of a truck headed for the Gros Ventre town cemetery The legendary winter of 19 We really caught hell that time Particularly those steaders in Scotch Heaven Poor snowedin bastards The banks going under in the early Twenties the tide of homesteaders reversing itself Another time I can tell In honor of Canada Dan you might say Must of been the summer of 16 I was up in Browning when one of those big sheep outfits out in Washington 150 shipped in 5000 ewes and lambs Gonna graze them there on the north end of the Two Those sheep came hungry from 18 hours on the stock cars and they hit the flats out there and got onto deathcamas and lupine Started dying by the hundreds We got hold of all the pinanginated potash and sulfate of aluminum there was in the drugstore at Browning and sent guys to fetch all of it there was in Cut Bank and Valier and Gros Ventre too and we started in mixing the stuff in wash tubs and dosing those sheep Most of the ones we dosed pulled through okay but it was too late for about a thousand of them others All there was to do was drag in the carcasses and set them afire with brush We burned dead sheep all night on that prairie Those sheep pyres I believe were the story that made me check out of Stanleys comapnionship for the evening At least I seem to remember counseling myself not to think about deceased sheep in combination with the social juice Id been imbibing by now three cups worth Stanley on the other hand had hardly even sipped during this taletelling spell Ive about had a day I announced The bunk bed was noticeably more distant than itd been the night before but I managed to trek to it Adios till the rooster crows Stanleys voice followed me Or till the crow roosts I imparted to myself or maybe to a more general audience for at the time it seemed to me an exceptionally clever comment While my tongue was wandering around that way though and 151 my fingers were trying to solve the bootlace situation which for some reason began halfway down my boots instead of at the top where I was sure they ought to be my mind was not idle Cowboying teamstering river pigging all this history of Stanleys was unexpected to me Id supposed from my distant memory of him having been in our lives when I was so small that he was just another camptender or maybe even an association rider back when this range was occupied by mostly cattle instead of sheep But riding along up here and being greeted by the elevationminded sheepherder as an expert on the Two that sounded like what hed been one of the early ranchers of this country Homesteader maybe Fighting that forest fire of 10 must have volunteered himself onto the fire crew association rider would fit that But dosing all those sheep that sounded like camptender again Then something else peeped in a corner of my mind One boot finally in hand I could spare the concentration for the question Stanley didn you say you been to this cabin before When we got here didn you say that Yes sir Been here just a lot of times I go back farther than this cabin does I seen it being built We was sighting out that f enceline over there when old Bob Barclay started dragging in the logs for this Being built Sighting the boundary fenceline The history was skipping to the most ancient times of the Two forest now and this turn and the whiskey together were compounding my confusion Also l52 somebody had put another boot in my hand Yet I persisted What were you up here with the Theologicthe Geologicthe survey crew Stanleys eyes were sharp as if a new set had been put in amid the webs of eyelines And the look he fastened on me now was the levelest thing in that cabin Jick I was the ranger that set up the boundaries of the Two Medicine National Forest Surely my face hung open so far you could have trotted a cat through it In any Forest Service family such as ours lore of setting up the national forests of the boundary examiners who established them onto the maps of America as public preserves was almost holy writ I could remember time upon time of hearing my father and the other Forest Service men of his age mention those original rangers and supervisors the ones who were sent out in the first years of the century with not much more than the legal description of a million or so acres and orders to transform them into a national forest The forest arrangers the men of my fathers generation nicknamed them Elers Koch on the Bitterroot National Forest CoertuBois on the Lolo other boundary men who sired the Beaverhead and the Custer and the Flathead and so on the tales of them still circulated refreshed by the comments of the younger rangers wondering how theyd managed to do all they had Famous famous guys Sort of combinations of Old Testament prophets and mountain men rolled into 153 one Everybody in the Forest Service told forest arranger stories at any chance But that Stanley Meixell wronghanded campjack and frequenter of Doctor Al K Hall had been the original ranger of the Two Medicine National Forest I had never heard a breath of And this was strange My sister is Mandy shes got a dandy At least so the boys say I woke with thatin my ears and a dark brown taste in my mouth The serious symptoms set in when I sat up in my bunk My eyes and temples and ears all seemed to have grown sharp points inward and were steadily stabbing each other Life the very air seemed gritty gray Isnt there one hangover description that your tongue feels like you spent the night licking ashtrays Thats it Morning there Jick Stanley sang out He was at the stove Here better wash down your insides with this Stepping over to the bunk he handed me a tin cup of coffee turned tan with canned milk Evidenly he had heated the milk along with the coffee because the contents of the cup were all but aflame The heat went up my nose in search of my brain as I held the cup in front of my lips No guarantee on this lefthanded grub Stanley called over his shoulder as he fussed at something on the stove top but how do you take your eggs Uh I sought around in myself for the information Flipped I guess Stanley hovered at the stove another minute or two while I made 154 up my mind to try the deathdefying trip to the table Then he turned and presented me a plate Lefthanded they may have been but the eggs were fried to a crisp brown lace at the edges while their pockets of yolk were not runny but not solidified either Eggs that way are perfection On the plate before me they were fenced in by wide tan strips of sidepork and within a minute or so Stanley was providing me slices of bread fried in the pan grease I am my mothers son entirely in this respect I believe good food never made any situation worse I dug in and by the time Id eaten about half the plateful things were tasting like they were supposed to I even managed to sip some of the coffee which I discovered was stout enough to float a kingbolt Indeed I swarmed on to the last bite or so of the feast before it occurred to me to ask Whered you get these eggs Aw I always carry a couple small lard pails of oats for the horses and the eggs ride okay in the oats Breakfast made me feel restored Speaking of riding I began how soon can we head down the mountain Stanley inventoried me And I took the chance to get in my first cleareyed look of the day at him Stanley seemed less in pain than he had when we arrived to this cabin but less in grasp of himself that he had during last nights recounting of lore of the Two A man in wait seeing which way he might turn but 155 unfortunately I knew the bottle habit soon would sway his decision Of course right then who was I to talk Now Stanley was saying Just any time now Jick We can head out as soon as you say ready On our ride down Stanley of course was into his musical repertoire woolly again one minute warbling about somebody who was wild and and full of fleas and neverd been curried above her knees and the next crooning a hymnlike tune that went Oh sweet daughters of the Lord grant me more that I can afford My mind though was on a thing Stanley said as we were saddling the horses In no way was it what I intended to think about for I knew fully that I was heading back into the McCaskill family situation that blowup between my parents and Alec Godamighty the supper that produced all that wasnt much more than a half a week ago And in the meantime my father had introduced Stanley and Canada Dan and Bubbles not to mention Dr Al K Hall into my existence There were words I intended to say to him about all this If that is I could survive the matter of explaining to my mother why the tops of my boots gaped out like funnels and how come my pants legs looked like Id wiped up a mountainside with them and where the tail of my shirt had gone Thank the Lord not even she could quite see into a person enough to count three tin cups of booze in him the night before On that drinking score I felt reasonably safe Stanley didnt seem to me likely to trouble 156 himself enough to advertise my behavior On the other hand Stanley himself was a logical topic for my mother More than likely my father had heard and I was due to hear her full opinion of my having sashayed off on this campjacking expedition A sufficiency to dwell on and none of it easy thinking Against my intentions and better interests though I still found myself going back and forth over the last scene at the cabin I had just handed the lead rope for the black pack mare and loving Bubbles up to Stanley and was turning away to go tighten the cinch on Ponys saddle It was then that Stanley said he hoped I didnt mind too much about missing the rest of the counting trip with my father to the Billy Peak lookout and all I couldnt of got along up here without you Jick he concluded and I hope you dont feel hard used Which of course was exactly how I did feel You damn bet I did Had been feeling ever since the instant my father volunteered me into Stanleys company and for all I knew was going to go on feeling that way until I was old and wise Skinning wet sheep corpses contending with a pack horse who decides hes a mountain goat nursing Stanley along lightning any number of selfcooked meals the hangover Id woke up withwhat sad sonofabitch wouldnt realize he was being used out of the ordinary Yet right then 18inch pincers would not have pulled the confession of that from me I wouldnt give the universe the satisfaction 157 So No I had answered Stanley shortly and gone on over to do my cinching No its all been an education
