 511 Well be in it inside of six months was one school of thought when Europe went to war in September of 1939 and the other refrain ran Its their own scrap over there we can just keep our nose out this time But as ever history has had its own say and in a way notjf oretoldat Pearl Harbor last Sunday in the flaming message of the Jap bombs Gros Ventre Weekly Gleaner Dec 11 1941 All the people of that English Creek summer of 1939they stay on in me even though so many of them are gone from life You know how when you open a new book for the first time its pages linger against each other pull apart with a reluctant little separating sound They never quite do that again the linger or the tiny sound Maybe it can be said that for me that fourteenth sununer of my existence was the new book and its fresh pages My memories of those people and times and what became of them those are the lasting lines within 512 the book there to be looked on again and again whenever the mood of wonder asks to My mother was the earliest of us to get word of Pearl Harbor on that first Sunday of December 1941 The phone rang she answered it and upon learning that the call was from Two Medicine National Forest headquarters in Great Falls she began to set them straight on the day of the week When told the news from Hawaii she went silent and held the receiver out for my father to take In a sense Alec already had gone to the war by then At least he was gone with the war as a kind of excuse For when the fighting started in Europe and the prospect for cattle prices skyrocketed Wendell Williamson loaded up on cattle Wendell asked Alec to switch to the Deuce W his ranch down in the Highwood Mountains as a top hand there during this buildup of the herd Just after shipping time midSeptember of 1939 Alec went It may come as no vast surprise that he and Leona had unraveled by then She had chosen to start her last year of high school Alec was smarting over her decision to go that way instead of to the altar and my belief is that he grabbed the Deuce W job as a way to put distance between him and that disappointment I saw Leona the day of the Gros Ventre centennial several years ago now She is married to a man named Wright and they run a purebred Hereford ranch down in the Crazy Mountains country The beauty still have a hard time forgiving life for that Ray Heaney and I went together to the induction station in Missoula in September of 1942 about a week after my eighteenth birthday And we saw each other during basic training at Fort Lewis out in Washington In the war itself though we went separate ways Ray spent a couple of years of fighting as a rifleman in Italy and somehow came through it all These days Ray has an insurance agency over in Idaho at Coeur dAlene and we keep in touch by Christmas card I wound up in a theater of World War Two that most people dont even know existed the Aleutians campaign away to hell and gone out in the northern Pacific Ocean off Alaska Those Aleutian islands made me downgrade the wind of the Two country There is not a lot else worth telling in my warrior career for early in our attack on Cold who Mountain I was one of an Attu tattooa Jap bullet in my left leg breaking the big bone not far above the ankle Even yet on chilly days I am reminded down there When the Army eventually turned me loose into civilian life I used my GI bill to study forestry at the university in Missoula Each of those college summers I worked as a smokejumper for the Forest Service parachuting out of more airplanes onto more damn forest fires than now seems sane to me And in the last of those smokejumping summers I began going with a classmate of mine at the university a young woman from there in the Bitterroot country The 513 shines out of Leona Ranch work and the riding she does have kept her in shape I couldnt help noticing But one thing did startle me Leonas hair now is silvery as frost She smiled et my surprise and said Gold to silver Jick Youve seen time cut my value Left to my own devices I would not tell any further about Alec Yet my brother his decisions the consequences life dealt him always are under that summer and its aftermath like the paper on which a calendar is printed Before he enlisted in the Army the week after Pearl Harbor Alec did come back to Gros Ventre to see our parents Whether conciliation is the right amount of word for that visit I dont really know for I was on a basketball trip to Browning and a ground blizzard kept those of us of the Gros Ventre team there overnight So by the time I got back Alec had been and gone And that last departure of his from English Creek led to a desert in Tunisia How stark it sounds yet it is as much as we ever knew A Stuka finding that bivouac at dusk swooping in and splattering 20millimeter shells Of the cluster of soldiers who were around a jerry can drawing their water rations only one man lived through the strafing He was not Alec So My last words with my brother were those on the telephone when I tried to talk him into going to the Flume Gulch fire I do day after graduation in 1949 we were married That marriage lasted just a year and a half and it is not something I care to dwell on That same graduation summer I took and passed the Forest Service exam and was assigned onto the Custer National Forest over in eastern Montana I suppose one of the Mazoola desk jockeys thought it scrupulous or found it in some regulation that most of the state of Montana should be put between me and my father on the Two But all that eastern Montana stint accomplishedhell even the name got me down that dodo Custerwas to cock me into readiness to shoot out of the Forest Service when the chance came Pete Reese provided the click As soon as his lambs were shipped in the fall of 1952 Pete offered me a first crack at the Noon Creek ranch Maries health was giving outshe lived only a few more years dark lovely doe she wasand Pete wanted to seize an opportunity to buy a sheep outfit down in the Gallatin Valley near Bozeman where the winters might not be quite so ungodly I remember every exact word from Pete in that telephone call Youre only an accidental nephew but I suppose maybe I can give you honorary soninlaw terms to buy the place I took Pete up on his offer and came back to the Two Medicine country so fast I left a tunnel in the air On the 21st of March of 1953we kidded that going through a lambing time together would tell us in a hurry whether we could stand each other the rest of our livesMarcella Withrow and I were married Her first marriage to a young dentist at Conrad had not panned out either and she had come back over to Gros Ventre when the job of librarian opened up That first winter of mine on the Reese place I resorted to the library a lot and it began to dawn on me that books were not the only attraction I like to think Maree and I are both tuned to an echo of Dode Life is wide theres room to take a new run at it In any event Maree and I seem to have gotten divorce out of our systems with those early wrong guesses and we have produced two daughters one married to a fishandgame man up at Sitka in Alaska the other living at Missoula where she and her husband both work for the newspaper We also seem to be here on Noon Creek to stay for as every generation ends up doing on this ranch we have lately built a new house Four such domiciles by now if you count the Ramsay homestead where I was born It cost a junior fortune in doubleglazing and insulation but we have windows to the mountains all along the west wall of this place These September mornings when I sit here early at the kitchen table and watch dawn come to the skyline of the Two coffee forgotten and cold in my cup the view is worth any price The thirtyplus years of ranching that Maree and I have put in here on Noon Creek have not been easy Tell me what is But so far the pair of us have withstood coyotes and synthetic fabrics and Two country winters and the decline of sheepherders to persevere in the sheep businessalthough we have lately diversified into some 517 Charolais cattle and several fields of that new sanfoin alfalfa I am never going to be redhot about being a landlord to cows And the problem of finding decent hay hands these days makes me positively pine for Wisdom Johnson and Bud Dolson and Perry Fox But Maree and I are agreed that we will try whatever we have to in order to hang on to this land I suppose even dude ranching though I hope to Christ it never quite comes to that Along English Creek the main change to me whenever I go over there is that sheep are damn few now Cattle a lot of new farming those are what came up on the next spin of the agricultural roulette wheel About half the familiesHahns Frews Roziers another generation of Busby brothersstill retain the ranches their parents brought through the Depression The Van Bebber ranch is owned by a North Dakotan named Florin and he rams around the place in the same slambang fashion Ed did Maybe there is something in the water there And Dode Withrows place is run by one of Dodes other soninlaws Beas husband Merle Torrance Dode though is still going strong the old boy Weathered as a stump but whenever I see that fatherinlaw of mine he is the original Dode What do you know for sure Jick people Have they found a cure yet for sf in the sonof abi tching sheep business Anyway except fer big aluminum sheds and irrigation sprinklers slinging water over the fields you would not find the ranches of 518 English Creek so different from the way they were The Double W now is owned by a company called TriGram Resources which bought it from the California heirs after Wendell Williamsons death As a goddamn tax writeoff need I say How can it be twenty years since my father retired from the Forest Service Yet it is After this summer I have told about the next year was awful on him what with Alec gone from us to the Deuce W and the decision from Mazoola in the winter of 1939 to move my fathers district office from English Creek into Gros Ventre Access realignment they called it and showed him on paper how having the ranger station in town would put him closer by paved road to the remote north portion of the Two He kicked against it in every way he could think of even wrote to the Regional Forester himself the Major Since when is running a forest a matter of highway miles Before long though the war and its matters were on my fathers mind and the mail was bringing Forest Service posters urging LETS DELIVER THE WOODS ax to down the Axis The way the water of a stream riffles around a rock the Forest Services flow of change went past my father Major Kelley departed Missoula during the war to California to head up the government project of growing guayule for artificial rubber Id rather take a beating than admit it my father confessed but I was kind of 519 getting used to those goddamn kelleygrams The Two supervisor Ken Sipe was tapped for a wartime job at Forest Service headquarters in Washington DC and stayed on back there Their successors in Region One and the Two Medicine forest headquarters simply left my father in place rangering the English Creek district I have heard of a ranger out in the state of Washington who spent a longer career on a district but my fathers record wasnt far behind His first winter of retirement in Gros Ventre was a gloomy and restless time for him although my mother and I could never tell for sure how much of that was retirement and how much just his usual winter It was a relief to us all when spring perked him up I had a call from him the morning of the first day of fishing season Bet you a beer youve forgotten how to string ten fish on a willow I cant get away I had to tell him Ive got ewes and lambs all over creation out here You sure you wouldnt like to take up a career as a bunch herder Brook trout he informed me are the only kind of herd that interests me Youre missing a free chance at a fishing lesson Ill cash that offer on Sunday okay You can scout the holes for me today I want Mom to witness your count when you get home a though Itis past time I owed a beer and its beginning to dawn on me that your arithmetic oould be the reason Thatll be the day he rose to my joshing When I dont bring 520 home ten fish on a willow As will be shown to you personally on Sunday When he hadnt returned by dusk of that day ffiY mother called me at the ranch and I then called Tom Helwig the deputy sheriff I drove across the divide to English Creek and just before full dark found my fathers pickup parked beside the North Fork on Walter Kyles old place Tom Helwig and I and the men from the English Creek ranches searched and searched hollering in the dark until giving up about midnight with first light of the next morning I was the one who came onto my father His body rather stricken by a heart attack away back in the brush atop a beaver dam hed been fishing Nine trout on the willow stringer at his side the tenth still on the hook where my father had dropped his pole Jick the summer when Alec left Could it have come out different If your father and I hadnt kept at him hadnt had should our notions of what it all have been different My mother brought this up in the first week after my father passed away In a time like that the past meets you wherever you turn The days do not use their own hours and minutes they find ones you have lived through with the person you are missing Only that once though in all the years from then to now did she wonder that question aloud The other incidents of the summer of 1939 we often talk over when I stop by to see how she 521 is doing She has stayed on in her own house in Gros Ventre Im sufficient company for myself this mother of mine maintains She still grows the biggest vegetable garden in town and is perpetual president of the library board What irks her is when people regard her as she puts it as if I was Some Kind Of A Monument I had to talk hard when her birthday came this February and the new young editor of the Gleaner wanted to interview her Gros Ventre Woman stories are though It is hard to fit such a life into mere inches of words father I had never told her or Alecs refusal that noon when I phoned him about the Flume Gulch fire And I did not when she asked could it would it all have come out different But what I did say to her was the one truth I could see in that distant English Creek summer If you two hadnt had the notions you did you wouldnt have been yourselves And if Alec hadnt gone his way he wouldnt have been Alec She shook her head Maybe if it had been other times Maybe I said And Stanley Meixell Stanley stayed on with the Busby brothers until their lambs were shipped that fall of 1939 then said he thought hed go have a look at Oregonalways did like that name Early in the war the Busbys received word that he was working in a shipyard out there 522 at Portland After that nothing So I am left with the last scene of Stanley after the Flume Gulch fire before my father and I headed in to Gros Ventre I went over to where Stanley was stirring a pot of gravy Yes sir Jick Looks like this feedlot of ours is about to close down Stanley I heard myself saying all that about the Phantom Woman fireI dont know who was right or wrong or if anybody was or what But Im sorry about the way things turned out back then A McCaskill wholl outright say the word sorry replied Stanley He tasted the gravy then turned to me his dark eyes steady within the weave of squint lines I was more right than I even knew that time What time was that When I told your folks you looked to me like the jick of the family
