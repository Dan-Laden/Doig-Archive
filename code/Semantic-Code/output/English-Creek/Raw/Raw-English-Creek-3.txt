 336 Thesun shines hay is being made All along English Creek and Noon Creek mowing and raking and stacking are the order of the day As to how this years cutting compares with those of recent you seen any rancher lately who wasnt grinning like a Christian holding four aces July 20 Hand me a halfinch would you Jick Here you go I passed the openend wrench of that size to Pete beneath the power buckrake There was a grunt of exertion a flash of metal as the wrench flew and clattered off the chassis and the news from Pete Sonofabitch must be a threeeighths I had been here before Did you hit your knuckles Sure did Did you round the head off the bolt Sure did Are you sure you want toput up hay again this year Guess what nephew The nextrustedup sonofabitch of a bolt under here has got your name on it At noon of that first day of preparing Petes haying machinery when he and I came in to wash up for dinner Marie took one look at the 337 barked knuckles and skin scrapes and blood blisters on the both of us and inquired Did you two count your fingers before youstarted all this Despite what it took out of a persons hide I still look back on that as topnotch employment myjob of haying for Pete The Reese ranch was a beauty for hay Pete inherited not only my grandfather Isaac Reeses acreage there along Noon Creek but old Isaacs realization that nurturing more than one source of income is as good an idea as you can have in Montana Pete was continuing with the sheep Isaac hadturned to after the crash of cattle prices and also was improving the ranchs hayfields running ditches into the bottomland meadows of wild hay to irrigate from Noon Creek Even in the Depressions driest years Pete always had hay to sell during the Thisyear it looked as if he would have a world of the stuff Those tallgrass meadows lay oneafter another along the creek like green poucheson a thong Then there was the big field atop the Noon CreekEnglish Creek divide which grew dryland alfalfa In a wet year like this one the alfalfa was soaring up more than knee high and that widebenchland field looked as green as they say the Amazon is first days after the Fourth of July the hay was very nearly ready for us and I was more thanready for it Ready to have the McCaskill family situation off my mindforthe main part of each day at leat It did not take a great deal of original thinking to realize that the deadlock between my parents and Alec now wasstouter 338 than it had been If Alec ever needed any confirming in his rooting tootingcowboy notion of himself his rodeo day calf roping and pugilistic triumphs had more than done so Both of those and Leona tooAlecs eet might not even touch the ground until about August Anyway I had spent so muchthought on the Alec matter already that summer that my mind was looking around for a new direction My father my mother my brother let them do the sorting out of Alecs future I now had an imminent at Noon Creekall my own I might have known The summer when I have said my mother ever after called this one For me the sunnner when not even haying turned out as expected The summer when I beganto wonder if anything ever does To bequite honest on a task like those first few days of readying the equipment for haying I providedPetemore company than help I mean I can fix machinery when I haveto but Id rather be doing anything else My point of view is that Iwould be more enthusiastic about the machine era if thestuff healed itself instead of requiring all the damn repair it does And Pete was much the same as me where wrench work was involved But Istill maintain companionship is no small thing to create Amid allthat damn bolting unbolting rebolting bushing shimming washering greasing oiling banging sharpening straightening wouldnt youwelcome a little conversation And the farther removed 339 from the mechanical chore at hand the better At least my uncle and I 0 I recall Pete just right out of the blue telling me about the Noon Creek KeeKee bird You never heard of the KeeKee birdwe got around here Jick I am surprised at you The KeeKee bird shows up the first real day of winter every year Lands on top of the lambing shedover there and takes a look all around Then he says KeeKeeKeerist All Mighty this is cccold cccountry and heads for California I inreturn favoredPete with a few of the songs from Stanleys repertoire starting with the one about the lady who was wild and woolly andfull of fleas and never had been curried above her knees surprised He looked a my musical knowledge but was interested enough Thissticks with me too how startling it was to hear from a face so reminiscent of my mothers the kind of languagePete unloosed on the haying equipment during those repair days It also was kind of refreshing All in all then Pete and I got along like hand and glove And I have already recited Maries glories back there at the Fourth of July picnic If anybody in the Two country could cook in the same league as my mother it was Marie So my ears and the rest of me both were well nourished that couple of days as Pete and I by main strength and awkwardness got the haying gear into running order It never occurred to me at the time but I suppose Pete welcomed having me aroundand Alec in the earlier summers when he was in the raking jobbecause he and Marie were childless Their son died at birth and Marie verynearly died with him 340 Her health in fact had neverbeen strong So for a limited time at least someone my age was a privileged character with the Reeses Even so I held off until Pete and I were finishing up the last piece of equipment replacing broken guards on the mowing machine before I tried him on this Pete you know Stanley Meixell dont you Used to Why Im just sort of curious My folks dont say much about him Hesbeen a long time gone from this country Old history Were you around him when he was the English Creek ranger Some When anybody on Noon Creek who could spell K0W was running cattle up there on the forest During the war and just after that wqs How was he as a ranger How was he Well yeqh I mean did Stanley go about things prettymuch the way Dad does Fuss over the forest like he was its motherhen sort of Stanley always struck me as more of a rooster than a mother hen That I didnt get Stanley hadnt seemed to me particularly strutty in the wayhe went about lite But I will say this Pete went on Stanley Meixell and your father know those mountains of the Twobetter than anybody else alive Theyre a pair of a kind on that They are That thebungedup whiskeysloshing camptender I had squired around up there in the Two was asmuch a master of the mountains 341 as my due respect toPete but I couldnt credit it Figuring maybe Petes specific knowledge of Stanley wasbetter than his general I asked Well after he was the English Creek ranger where was his ticket to His ticket Thats the saying they have in the Forest Service about being transferred After here where didStanley get transferred to The Forest Service isnt my ball of string Jick How do you feel about sharpening some mower sickles Theres acouple against the wallof the shop somewhere Hows she going Jick The third morning I rodeover to Pete and Maries the mower man Bud Dolson greeted methere at breakfat Pete had gone into Gros Ventreto fetch him the night before Bud having come up on the bus all the way from Anaconda Ordinarilyhe was on the bull gang at the smelter therea kind of roustabouts job as I understood it Goodto get out in the real air for a change Bud claimed was his reason for coming to mow hay for Pete summer after summer Smelter fumes would besufficient propulsion to anywhere yes But I have a sneaking hunch that the job as mower man a month of being out here by himself with just a team of horses and a mowing machine and the waiting hay meant a lot in itself to somebody as quiet as Bud The first genuine scorching day of summer arrived with Bud and 342 by about 9 oclock the dew was off the hay andhe wascuttingthe first swath of the nearest of the Noon Creek meadows a path of fallen green beside the standing green How do Jick While I was saddling Pony to go home to English Creek at the end of that afternoon Perry Fox came riding in from Gros Ventre You still could find Perrys species in a lot of Montana towns then old Texas punchers who rode north on a trail drive somewhere before the turn of the century and for this reason or that never found their way back toTexqs Much of the timewhen I was growing up Gros Ventre had as many as three of them Andy Cratt Deaf Smith Mitchell and Perry Fox They had all been hands forthe old Seven Block ranch when it was the cattle kingdom of this part of Montana then afterward hung on by helping out the various small ranchers at branding time andwhen the calves were shipped and in between breaking a horse for somebody now and again Perry Fox was the last of them alive yet Into his seventies Iguesshe had to be for Toussaint Rennie told my father he could remember seeing both Perry and Deaf Smith Mitchell in the roundup of 1882 skinny youngsters aboard big Texican saddles Now too stoveup for a regular ranch job Perry spent his winters in Dale Quiggs saddle store helping out with harness mending and other leather work and his summer job was on the dump rake for Pete As L responded to Perrys nod and drawl of greeting and watched him undo his bedroll and war bag from behind his saddlelike Bud Perry v 343 would put up inthe bunkhouse here at Petes now until haying was I couldnthelp but notice that he had a short pieceof rope stretched snug beneath his horses belly and knotted into each stirrup This was a new one on me tied like that That night I asked my father about it Come to that has hemy father said Riding with hobbled stirrups I still didnt savvy At his age Perry cant afford to get thrown any more my father spelled it out for Hes too brittle to mend So with the stirrups tieddown that way he can keep himself clamped into them if his horse starts to buck Maybe he just ought to quit riding horseback I said without thinking it through My father set mestraight on that tqo Guys like Perry if they cant rideyou might as well take them out and shoot them Perry has never learned to drive a car The minute he cant climb onto a horse and keep himself there hes The fourth morning Pete had me harness up my team of horses and take my rake to the mowed field to help Perry get the dump raking underway 4f Truth be told that day I was the one who did the majority of the dump rakingscooping the hay into windrows that waswhile Perry tinkered and tinkered with his rake teeth and hisdump lever and his horses harness and so on Right then Ifully subscribed to what Pete said about hiscustom of hiring Perry haying after haying Hes slow as the 344 wrath of Christ but he issteady I suppose if mybehind was as aged and bony as Perrys I wouldnt have been in anyhurry either to apply it to a rake seat for the coming four or five weeks At the end of that day of windrowing when Perry and I had unhitched our teams and Pete was helping us lookthem over for any harness sores up the road to the ranch buildings came the Forest Servicepickup and in it my father and my mother as well Theyd been to Great Falls on a headquarters trip my father hadto make feJ sse easaft and beforestarting home they swung by First Avenue South to chauffeur the last of the haying crew to Pete He tumbled out of the back of the pickup now The stackman Wisdom Johnson Hey Pete cried Wisdqm Even after ride from Great Falls in the open breezes Wisdom was not what could be called even approximately sober On the other hand he wasnt so swacked he had fallen out of the pickup on the way to the jqb which was the hiring standard that counted Hey Perry the greeting process went on Hey Jick If the entire population of Montana had been there in theReese yard Wisdom would have greeted every one of them identically Wisdom Johnsons mind may not have been one of the worlds broadest but it liked to practice whateverit knew As L savvy it Wisdom acknowledged Pete thats what youre here for all Pete Im ready for it Wisdom testified earnestly If you want to startstacking right now I am ready You bet I am Howabout it 345 ready to go Wisdom squinted around like Lewis and Clarkmust have Wheres the field Wisdom its suppertime Pete pointed o t Morning will be soon encugh to start stacking You feel like having some grub Wisdom considered No No I He swallowed to get rid of the idea of food What I need to do is sort of sit down for awhile Perry stepped forward Ill herd him to the bunkhoue Right this way Wisdom Whered you winter Outonthe coast reported Wisdom as he unsteadily accompanied Perry Logging camp up north of Grays Harbor Rain Perry do you know itd sometimes rain a week steady I just did not know it could rain that much Chin in hand and elbow propped on the doorframe my mother skeptically watched allthisout the window of the pickup Now she opened the door and steppedo t Not surprisingly she looked about twothirds riled I dont know of any Montana woman who has never gritted her teeth one time or another over that process of prying men off bar stools and getting them launched toward whatever theyre supposed to be doing in life Ill go in and visit Marie she announced which my father and Pete and Iall were glad enough to have happen Pete made sure my mother wasout of earshot then inquired He in Shebas place was he No inthe Mint though he did have Bouncing Betty with him She wasnt about to turn loose of him as long as he had a nickel to his Upon study my father looked somewhat peevish tqo Wisdom 346 Johnson must have taken considerable persuading to part with Bouncing Betty So atleast I didnt have to shake him directlyout of a whores bed But thats about the best I can say for your caliber of employee brotherinlaw Pete broke a grin at my father and razzed I wouldnt be so damn hard up for crew if youd paid attention to the example of Good Help Hebner and raised anything besides an occasional scatter raker Somehow Pete had known what the moment needed Petes kidding had within it the fact that the other of the rakedriving McCaskill brothers had been Alec and he was not a topic my father particularly cared to hear about these days Yet here it came the halfwink of my fathers left eye and the answer to Petes crack Scatter rakers were as good as I could do Whatever that says about my caliber The fifth day we made hay The windrows that Perry and I had raked formed a pattern I have always liked A meadow with ribs of hay evenly spaced Now Perry was dump the next field down the creek and Bud was mowing the one beyond that Those of us in the stacking crew began our end of the matter We sited the overshot stacker toward the high edge of the meadow so the haystack wouldbe up out of the deepest winter snowdrifts along Noon Creek With the power buckrake Pete shoved several loads of hay into place behind the stacker Then Wisdom maneuvered and smoothed that accumulation with his pitchfork until he had the base of his stack 347 made the way he wanted Lt An island of hay almost but not quite square8 paces wide lQ paces longand aoout Chest high You said last night youre ready Wisdom called Pete Here it comes And he the first load of hay onto the fork of the stacker o Send it to heaven Claytqn The final man or I should say member of our haying crew was the stacker team driver 12yearold Clayton Hebnero Petealways hired whichever Hebner boy was in the12to14 year range for that stacker team job and theywere prettymuch interchangeable a skinny kid with a forelock and nothing to say for himself apparently the volume knob for that whole family was onGood HelpHebner All that was really noticeableabout Clayton was his Hebner way of always eyeing you as if youwerethe latest link inevolution and he didnt want to miss the moment when you sprouted wings or finso At Petes words Clayton now started into motion histeamofhorses wihich were hitched to the cable which through a tripodandpulley rig within the stacker lifts the twin armsof the stacker and the hayloaded fork and the hay went up and up until It occurs to me does everybody these days think that hay naturally comes in bales That God ordainedthat livestockshall eat from 80pound loaves of hay tied up in twine by 10000 machinery If so maybe I had better describe thenotion of haying asit used to be All in the world it amounted to was gathering hay into stacks about the size of an adobe house a wellbuilt haystackeven looks assolid and as an adobestructure though of course stands higher and has aroundedoff 348 tqp But try it yourself sometime this gathering of 10 or 12 tons of hay into one stack and you will see where all the equipment comes in Various kinds of stackers were used in various areas of the Westbeaverslides Mormon derricks 0 ka jayhawksbut Petes preference was an overshot An overshot stacker worked as its name suggests tossing a load of hay upover a high wide framework which served as a sort of scaffolding for the front of the haystaGk If say you hold your arms straight out in front of you with your hands clutching each end of a basket with hay piled in it now bring your arms and the basket straight upover your head with a little speed and you are tossing the hay exactly as anovershot does In short a kind of catapult principle is calculated it is the responsibility of the stacker team driver to pace his horses so that the overshot ts arms and fork fling the hay onto whichever part of the stack the stackman wants it Otherthanbeing in charge of the speed of the team though driving the stacker teamis ahell of a dull job walking back and forth behind the horses as they run the overshot up and down all damn day long and thats why a kid like Clayton usually gotput on the tak So hay wasbeing sent up and as this first haystack and the days temperatureboth began to rise Wisdom Johnson suffered This too was part of thestart of hayingWisdom sweating the commerce of Great Falls saloons out of himseif Soaking himself sober lathering into the summers labqr We all knew by heart what the scene would be this initial morning Wisdomlurching around upthere atopthemound of hay as if he had a log chained to each leg It was a little painful to watch especially now that my camptending sojourn with Stanley Meixell had taught me what 349 a hangover truly Ls Yet agonizedas Wisdom looked thestack was progressing prettily as we also knew it would The stackman he was maestro of the haying When the rest of us had done our mowing or raking or bucking or whatever the final result of it all was the haystacks the stackman built And Wisdom Johnson could build them as he put it higft and tall and straight No question about it Wisdom was as big and oramy as they come nine of him would have made a And he also just looked as if he belonged atop a haystack pitch hay for he was swarthy enough to be able to all day up there without his shirt on which I envied muGh If I tried that Id have burned and blistered to a pulp Wisdom simply darkened and darkened his suntan a litmus each Stimmer of how far along our haying season was As July heated up into August more than once it occurred to me that with the sweat bathing Wisdom as he worked up there next to the sun and his arm muscles bulging ashe shoved the hay around and that dark leathering of his skin he was getting to look like the heavyweight fighter Joe LouLs But of course that wasnt something you said to a white person back then This wasthe second slimmer of Wisdom being known as Wisdom instead of his true name Cyrus Johnson The nickname came about because he had put up hay a number of seasons inthe Big Hole Basin down in the southwestern part of thestate and according to him the Big Hole was the front parlor of The hay there was the best possible the workhorses all hut put their harnesses onthemselves each morning the piesof Big Hole ranch cooks nearly floated off into the air from the 350 swBds of meringue atop them The list of glories ran on and qn Inasmuch as the Big Hole had a greatreputation for hay even without the testimony of Cyrus Johnson the rest of us at the Reese table tended tonod and say But then came one suppertime early in the first sunnner I hayed for Pete when Cyrus started in on a fresh Big Hole glmy You take that Wisdom now Theres my idea of a town Its the friendliest drinkingest prettiest place Wisdom Th lt burg Ordinarily Bud Dolson was silence himself But Anaconda where he was from was not all that far from the Big Hole town of Wisdom and Bud had been As Cyrus now had the misfortune of I think so replied Bud I blinked I mightve missed most of it Cyrus looked hurt Now what do you mean by that Cy Imean that the town of Wisdom makes the town of GrosVentre look like London Aw come on Wisdom is a hell of a nice town Bud shook his head in pity If you say so Wisdqm And ever since the big stackman was Wisdom Johnson to This firststack waswell underway Pete had buckraked several windrows in to Now began my contribution to the haying process I went over and climbed onto myscatter If you happennever to have seen one a scatter rake simplyresembles a long axleIDine was a 10foot typebetween a set of iron wheels high 351 spoked ones about as big around as those you think of a stagecoach having hutnotnearly so thick and heayy The axle actually the chassis of the rake carries a row of long thin curved teeth set about a hands width apart from each other andit is this regiment of teeth that rakes along the ground and scrapes together any stray hay lying theie As if the hayfield was a head of hair and the scatter rake a big iron comb going over it so to speqk Midway between the driver wheels aseatstuck up for the ride on and a wooden tongue extended forward for a team of horses to be hitched to My team was in harness and waitiIg Blanche and Fisheye As workhorses go they werent too bad a pair a team as you didntneed the biggest horses in the world just to pull a scatter rake but more onthe steady side than That Blanche and Fisheye were civilized at all was a relief to me becauseyou never know what you might get in ateam of horses One of them maybe can pull like aPercheron but is dumb and the other one clever enough to teach geometry but so lazy he constantly lays back in the traces Or onehorse may be a kicker and his mate so mild you could pass a porcupine under him without respone So except for Fisheye staring sideways at you in a fishy way as you harnessed him and Blanche looking like she needed a nap all the time this team of mine was better than the horse of might suggest Lbelieve Lam right in sayingPete was the first rancher in the Two countryto use a power old automobile chassisandengine with a fork mounted on it to buck the hay in from the field to 352 the staGk Wisdom Johnson a few sunnners hefore had brought word of the invention of the powerbuckrake in the Big Hole I tell you Pete they got them all over that countiy They move hay faster than you can see That proved to be not quite the case but the contraption could bring in hay as fast as two buckrakes propelled by horses Thus the internal combustion engine roared into the Reese hayfields and speeded matters up hut it also left dabs of haybehind it scatterings which had either blown off the huckrake fork orwhich it simply missed The scatter raker was the gatherer of that leftover hay which otherwise wouldbe In place on my rake seat I now clucked to Blanche and Fisheye reined them toward the part of the meadow Pete had been bucking in loads from and my second summer of scatter raking was begun Isuppose I have to admit anylody who could handle a team of workhorsescould run a scatter But not necessarily run it as it ought to he dole The trick was to stay on the move but at an easy paGe Keepthe horses in mild motion and the rake teeth down there gatheringleftover bay instead of racing around here and yqn Roam and glean hy going freestyle over a field as a fancy skater swoops around on iGe Well really net quite that free and fancy for with the horses and a 10foot rake you are directing maybe a ton and a half of moving the horse portion of it possessed of some notions of itsown and your maneuvers accordingly have to besomewhat approximate Butstill I say the more you could let yourself go and just follow the flow of the hayfield soto speakawoop in where the power buckrakehad recently lieen even if there wasnt much spilled hay 353 there the better off you were as a scatter A mind as loose as mine was about right for scatter rakitg How did it go my mother asked that first night of full haying Wewere waiting supper for my father who

greeted my fathers late arrivq1 Wash up and sit up you two supper will be just a minute nqw 11 Howdit go today my fatherasked me and I repeated my report of Reese haying Through that and other supper conversationhe nodded and said uhhuh a lot which signaled that he was only The symptom was annual At this point of the summer and hot as this onesuddenly had turned fire was forever on the mind of a forest ranger The joke was told that whenthe preacher at a funeral asked if anyone wanted tomemorializethedeceased a ranger was the first one onto his feet and oegan Old Tom wasnt the worst fellow I ever knew Now prevention Id like to add a few words about fire 1 When you think about it my fathers yearly deep mood about fire was understandaole enough He was responsible for an entire horizon The skyline made up of peaks and reefs and timbered slopes and high grasslands that conglomeration of nature was designated his district of the Two Medicine National Forest and every blessed inch of it was 355 prey to lightning storms and careless campfires and flipped cigarettes His line of defense was a light thread of men across that mass of mountain the lookouts in the tall towers and at this time of year sand start stationing in camps and cabins for quick combat against lightning strikes or smolders of any other sort My father entirely subscribed to the theory that the time to fight a forest fire was before it got True the timber of the Two here on the east face of the Rockies was not as big and dense and flammable asthe forests farther west in Montana and Idaho But that doesntmean theyre madeof goddamn asbestos either ran the complaint of eastside rangers on the Two the Lewis and Clark the Custer and the Helena against what they saw as a westward tilt in the thinking and the fire budget of Region One headquarters It was a fact that the legendary fires occurred over there west of the Continental Divi4e The Bitterroot blaze of 1910 was an absolute hurricane of flame Into smoke went 3 million acres of standing trees a lot of it the finest white pine in the wnrld And about half the town cf Wallace Idaho burned And this toothe Bitterroot fire killed 85 persons 84 of them done in directly by the flames and the other one walked off a little from a hotshot crew on Setzer Creek and put a pistol to himseJf The Forest Service which was only a few years old at the time was bloodied badly by the Bitterroot fire And as recently as 1934 there had been the fiasco of the Selway fires along the IdahoMontana That sunnner the Selway National Forest liecame the Alamo of Region Into those backcountry fires the regional forester Major Kelley and his 356 headquarters stqff poured 5400men and they never did get the flames Creek under contrql The Pete the Mcclendon Butte fire the Hell tte Fish Butte fire Gate fire east of the Lochsa River the Coolwater spot fire at Fish Butte Canyon Creek allwere roaring at onGe blew up a NothingtheForest Service tried onthe Selway worked Nothing could work really An inferno has no thermostqt In those years the official notion of a forest fire waswhat was called the policy aim for control of the fire by 10 the next morning My father was followig the reports ftom the Selway and said The Major better just aim for on Christmas Day for this Actually the rains of late September finally slowed the Selway fires and only weeks after that the Major killed off the Selway National Forest parceled out its landto theneighboring Clearwater and Nezperce forests and scattered its staff like the tribes of The Selway summer sobered everybodyworkingin Region totaldefeats by fire and the Majors obliteration of a National Forest unitand for damn sure no ranger wanted any similar nightmare erupting in his own distriGt Istopto recount all thisbecauseof what happened now as my father finished supper and thumbed open the days one piece of mail an official Forest Service envelope Whatve we got here he wondered the latest kelleygram His next utterance was 1Sonofabitch Helookedas if he had been hit with a 2 X 4 stunned and angry Then as if tlie words would have to change themselves when read aloud 357 he recited from the letter Placement of manpower this fireseason will be governed by localized fire danger measurements An enforced lag of manning below current danger will eliminate overmanning designed to meet erratic peak loads and will achieve material decrease in FF costs over past years expenditures Organization on eastside forestsin particular is to be held to the lowest level consistent with carefully analyzed current nee4s My mother oh so slightly shook her head as if this confirmed her suspicions of brainlessness in the upper ranks of Forest Service MY father crumpled the letter and crossed the kitchen to LRoostar Mountain anc the window looking out on Roman Reef andJPhantom Woman peak and other of profiles I asked Whats all that mean smokechasers or No ire guards on our side of the Divide until things start burning said my father without turning from the windqw Right up until the time haying started I had been rehearsing to myself how to talk my parents into letting me live in the bunkhouse at Petes with the rest of the hay crew It was something I imagined I much wanted to do Be in onthe gab of Wisdom and Perry and Bud hear all the tales of the Big Hole and First Avenue South and Texas and Anaconda and so on and so on Gain one more rung towards being a grownup Isuppose was what was working ori nie Yet when haying time arrived I did not even oring up the bunkhouse isslle For one thing I could anticipate my mothers enunciation about 358 one shave tail McCaskill already living in a bunkhouse and to judge by Alecsrecent behavior OneIs More Than Enough For another with my father on the go as much as he was this sunnnerit seemed plain that hewould preEer for me to be on hand at English Creek whenever he But do you know9 I actually made it unanimous against myself What the matter came right down to was that I didnt want to give up the porch bedroomat EnglishCreek for the dubious gain of bunking with hay hanqs Whichis how Ibecame a onehorsepower commuter The one horse being Pony whom I found I r egarded with considerable more esteem ever since Mouse decided to hose down the rodeo grounds that time in front of Leona Each morning now I got upat 5 went out and

sand The timbered crest of Breed Butte standing up against the stone mountain wall of the west What trick of lightit is I cant really say but everything looked as if drawn in heavy strokes with the final shade of night penciled in wherever there was a gulch or coulee The only breaks in the stillness were Ponys hooves against the earth and the wet breeze whichgenerally met us atop that broad benchland I say breeze In the Two country anything that doesnt lift you off your horse is only a oreeze My mountain coat was on me my hatpulled low my hands in leather work gloves and I was just about comfortable Since Petes haying season always lasted a month or a little more I rode right through the phases of the moqn My favorite you can guess on first tlY The fat full moon resting there as if it was an agate marblewhich hadrolled into the western corner of the sky During the early half of my route the mountainsstill drew most of their light from the moon and I watched the reefs and other rock faces change light gray to ever so slightly pinkas the sunrise began to touch them Closer to me the prairie flowers now made selves known amid the tan paintbrushes bluebells sunflowers Then this The first week or so of thos e daybreak rides the sun was nortli encugh that it came up oetween the Sweetgrass Hills They 360 stand 60 or 70 miles across the prairie from where I was riding way over towards Havre so there was a sense that I was seeing a sunrise happening in a The gap betweenthe mounded sets of hills first filled with a kind OIIHm a haze of coming light it might be called Then the sun would slowly present itself like a hi glowing coal burning its wayup througn the horizqn Those dawns taught me that beauty makes the eyes greedy For even after all this mountains and moon and earth edges and the coming 1 of the sun I considered that what wasmost worth watching for w1is the first shadow of the day When the sun worked its way about half above thehorizon that shadow emerged tostretch itself off from Pony andmeborse andyoungster melded into an apparition of leftover dark a couple of fiundredfeet in Drawnout on the prairie grass in that farreaching first shadow Pony and I

lightning storrm broke out in all too national 361 forests of Region One A lookout reported a plune of smoke up the South Fork of English Creek on a heavilyforested north slope of Grizzly Reef This of course caused sone excitement in the raq er station am my father hustled his assistant ranger Paul Eliason and sone trail mm and a nearby CCC brush crew up there Pauls used to those big trees out on the coast my father remarked to my mother It wont hurt him to finl out that the ores here are big enough to burn That Grizzly Reef smoke though turned out to be a rotten and soire other debris smoldering in a rocky area and Paul and his crew handled it without much sweat That midJuly dose of lightning arrl his dearth of fire guards am smoke chasers put my fat re r in wra t my mother called u his prowly mood But then on the mornirg of the 21st of July we woke up to snow in the moW1tains Fire was on the loose elsewhere in spot flles across the Continental Divide in the Flathead country and others up in Glacier Park and a big blaze dcwn in Yellowstone Park that hundreds of nen were onwhile my fathers forest lay urrler a cool sheet of white How did you arrange that mymother mockquestioned himat breakfaft Clean and heal thy thoughts The powerrr of Scotch prrayerrr he rumbled back at her in his preacher voice Then with his biggest grin in weeks Also known as the law of Tough it out long enough in this country and a snowstorm will eventually happen whenyou actually wantit to 362 As 1 say putting up Petes hay always took about a month given some days of being rained out or broke down This proved to be a sunnnerwhenwewere reasonably lucky aboutboth moisture and breakage Sosteadilythatnone of us on the crew said anything aboutit for fear of changing our luck day on day along Noon Creek our new stacks appeared like fresh green My scatter raking became automatic with me Of course whenever my mind doesnt have to be on what 1 am doing it damn well for sure 363 is going to be on some other Actually though for once in my life I did a respectable job of comoining my taskat hand and my wayfaring thoughts For if I had a single favorite daydream of those hayfield hours it was to wonder why a person couldnt be a roving scatter raker in the way that sheep shearers and harvest hands moved with their seaso11s I mean why not The principle seems to me the same a nomad professiqn I couldsee myself traveling through Montana from hay country to hay countryalthough preferably with better steppers than Blanche and Fisheye if there was much distance involvedand hlring on team and rake and all at the bestlooking ranch of each locale Maybe spend a week ten days at the peak of haying at each Less if the grub was mediocre longer if a real pie maker was in the Dwell in the bunkhouse so as to get to know everyliody on a crew for somehow every crew every hay hand was discernibly a little different from Then once I had learned enough about that particular country and earned from the boss the invite Be with us again next year wont you on I would go rolling on the iron wheels and line of tines of my scatter rake like some odd wide chariot rumbling down the roqd An abrupt case of wanderlust this may sound like but then it took very little to infect me at that age Can thisbe believed Except for once whenall of us at the South Fork school were taken to Helenato visit the capitol a onceinawhile trip with my father when he had to go to forest headquarters in Great Falls was the farthest I had ever been out of the Two countJy Ninety miles net much of a 364 grand There were places of Montana Icould barely even imagitle Butte All I knew definitely of Butte was that when yoti met anyone from there even somebody as mild as Ray Heaneys father Ed he would announce Im from Butte cind his chinwould shoot out a couple of inches on that of yewt In the midst of all this wide Montana scape a city whereshifts of lllen tunneled like gophers Butte the copper kingdqm Butte the dark mineral Or the other thing that was always saidButtes a hole in the ground and sos a grave That Iheard anyriumoer of times in the Two countly I think the truth may have been that parts of Montana like ours were apprehensive actually a little scared of Butte Thereseemed to be something spooky about a place that lived by eatingits own guts which is the way miningsounded to Butte I wouldsurely have to see somedqy And the Big Hole Basin As Wisdom Johnson told it as haying season approached in the Big Hole the hay hands they called them haydiggers downthere which I also gather about a week ahead of time They sifted in jungled up in the creekside willows at the edgeof town and visited and gossiped and just laid around until haying I savored thenotion of that the gathering the waiting Definitely the Big Holewould be on my hay rake route And the dryIngamar country down there in the southeastern part of the state where Walter Kyle had done his hotel style of sheep ranching Thetown watersupply was a tank car left off on the railroad siding each week Walter told of coming hack to town from sheep camp one late fall day and seeing flags of celebration flylilg His immediate 365 thought was that somebody had struck water but it turned out to be just the armistice ending the wqr11 Havre and the High Line country Fork Peck dqm Miles City Billings Lewistown White Sulphur Springs Red Lodge Bozeinan and the green Gallatin Valley For that matter Missoula Montana seemed tobe out there waiting for me if I only could become old enough to get theie Btit Theres always a but when you think about going everywhere and doingeverythirrn But how when I would be advanced enough to sample Montana to the full North of the earsstrange things will happen Do you know who kept coming to mind as I thought my way hither and thither from those Noon Creek hay meadows Stanley Meixell Stanley who had gone cowboying in Kansas when he was a hell of a lot younger than I WqS Stanleywhothere in the cabin during our camptending journey told me of bis wanders down to Colorado and Wyoming andover into the Dakotas in and out of Stanley who evidently so much preferred the wandering lifethat he gave upbeing a forest to pursue tt Stanley who could plop himself on a barstool onthe Fourthof July andbe found byVelma Sinnlls But Stanley who also looked worn down played out and overboozed by the footloose way of life The example of Stanley bothered me no little btt If the wanderers way was as alluring as it seemed from my seat on the scatter rake how then did I account forthe erodedlook aroundStanleyMeixells eyes Almost 0efore I knewit the first fewweeks of ha11ngwere behind 366 us andwe were moving the equipment onto the benchland fer theten days or so of putting uptheoig meadow of dryland alfalfa there The alfaloofee field as Perry Fox called Lt This was another turn of the summer I looked frward to with interest for this alfalfa haying was far enoughfrom the Reese ranch housethat we no longer went in at noon for Nowoegan field My stomach aside why did I look forward to this little season of field lunches I think the answer must be that the field lunches on the benchconstituted a kind of ritual that appealed to 1T1e Net that I would want to eat every meal of my life in the stubble of a hayfield But for ten days or so it was like camping out or being on an expedition possibly even a little like jungling up the way the Big Hole hayhands started oJf Whatever the alfaloofee field lunch routine went like A few minutes before noon here came Marie in the picktJp She had with her the chuck box the old Reese family wooden one with cattle brands burned everywhere on its sides and when a couple of us slid it back to the tailgate and lifted it down and opened it in there waited two orthree kinds of sandwiches wrapped in dishtowels and a bowl of potato or macaroni salad and a gallon jar of cold tea or lemonade and bread and butter and jam and pickles and radishes and new garden carrots and a pie or cake Each of us chose a dab of shade around the power ouckrake or the pickupmy preferencewas to sit on the running board of the pickup somehow it seemed more like a real meal when I sat up to then we ploughed into the lunch Afterward which is to say the rest of the noon nour Pete was a napper with his hat down 367 over his I never was I was afraid I might miss somethiIJg Clayton too was openeyed in that silent sentry way all the Hebner kids Perry and Bud smoked each rolling himself a handma4e This was the cue for Wisdom to pull out his own sack of Bull Durham pat his shirt pocket then say toPerry orBud You got a Bible on you One or the other would loan him the packet of cigarette papers and hed roll himself OIJe Strange howhe could always have tobaccobut petuallybe out of papers which were the half of smoking that cost almost nothing But that was Wisdom for you The womanly presence of Marie slim and dark sitting in the shade of the pickup beside the chuck box and the Pete posed the need for another As tea and lemonade caught up with kidneys we males one after another would rise carefully casual and saunter around to the far side of the haystack anddo our Then saunter back trying to look like wed never been away and Marie showing no least sign that we hqd Eventually Pete would rouse himself He not only could nap at the drop of an eyelid he woke up just as readiJy I dont suppose you characters finished this field while I was resting my eyes did you Then he was on his feet the rest of the backtowork message Until they invent hay that puts itself up I guess we got to Our last day of haying the benchland alfalfa brought two occurrences out of the ordinaJy The first cmne at once when I headed Blanche and Fisheye to the 368 southwest corner of the field to start the morning by raking there a while 1aybe a quarter of a mile farther from where I was lay a nice at too base of slope of Breed Butte The ground there was part of Walter Kyles place and with Walter summering in the mountains with his sheep Dode Withrow always put up the hay of this coulee for him on The Withrow stacking crew had pulled in and set up the afternoon before could pick out Dode over there still with a cast on his leg and I could all but hear him on the topic of trying to run a haying crew with his legset incement If I hadnt been so content with haY1ng for Pete Dode would have been my choice of somebody to work for Maybe scatter rakers are all born with similar patterns of behavior in them but in any case at this Same time I was working the corner of our field the Withrow rake driver was doing the nearest corner of theils Naturally I studied how he was going about matters and a minute or so of that showed me that he wasnt a he but Marcella Withrow I had no idea what the oddsmust be against a coincidence like thatMarcella and me been the only ones in our class those 8 years of grade schoolat South Fork andnowthe only English Creek ones in our particular high schoolclass in Gros Ventre and this moment both doing the same job in the same hay neighborhoqd It made me grin It also caused me to peek around with care to make sure that I wouldnt be liable for any later razzing from our crew and when the coast looked clear I waved to Marcella She did the same maybe evento checking over 369 her shoulder against the razzing possibility and we rattled past one another and raked our separate meadows Some news to tell Ray Heaney the next time I got to town anyway The other event occurred at noon and this one went by the name of Toussaint Rennie He arrived in the pickup with Marie and the chuck box of lunch I cane to make sure Toussaint announced his tan gullied face solemn as Solomon Whether you men build haystacks right side up Actually the case was that Toussaint had finished ditchriding for awhile with everybody harvesting now instead of irrigating and Marie had driven up to the Two Medicine to fetch him for company for the day What conversations went on between those two bloodandsoulmates Ive always wished I could have overheard The gab between the hay crew and Toussaint was pretty general though until we were done eating Pete then retired to his nap spot and Perry and Bud and eventually Wisdom lit up their smokes and so on A little time passed then Toussaint leaned from where he was sitting and laid his hand on the chuck box Perry he called over to Perry Fox We ate out of this a time before That we did agreed Perry But Maries style of grub is a whole helluva lot better Toussaint put his finger to the large F burnt into the end of the chuck box Dan Floweree 370 The finger moved tothe 9R brand ontheboxs side Louis Robare To the C beside it Billy Then to the lid where the space had been used to burn in a bigDS This oneyou know best Perty I straightened up It had come to me where Perry and Toussaint would have first eaten out of this chuck bqx When those cattle brands were firstseared into its woqd The famous roundup of 1882 from the elbow of theTeton River tothe Canadian line the one Toussaint told my father about the one he said was the biggest ever in this part of Montara Nearly 300men the ranchers and their cowhands and horse wranglers and niglit herders and tents it took to hold them Eachmorning the riders fanned out in half circles of about 15 miles ride and rounded in the cattle for sorting each afternoon thebranding fires of the several outfits sent smoke above the prairie as the irons wrote ownership onto living cowhiqe When the big sweep was over coulees and creek bottoms searched out over an area bigger than some eastern states about 100000 head of cattle were accounted fqr DavisHauserStuart Perry was saying of the brand on the chuck oox lid My outfit at the DHS the Damn Hard Sittir 11 Wisdom Johnson was beginning to catch up with the conversatiqn Where wasthis youre talking about All in through here Perry indicated with a slow swing of his head fromshoulder toshoulder Roundinup cattie Cattle Wisdom cast alook around the oenchland as if a herd 371 might be pawing out there this verymoment Around here It did seem a lot to believe that this alfalfa field and the farmland on the horizon east of us once was a grass heaven for cows Everywhere From the Teton to Canada those old outfits had cattle Perry conf If you could find the buggers Bud Dolson spoke up Whend all this take place Toussaint told him A time ago 2 1882 queried Wisdom Perry how ungodly old are you Perry pointed a thumb at Toussaint Yatmger n him Toussaint Everybody Ls How can pieces of time leap in andout of each other the way they do There I sat that noontime listening to Toussaint and Perry speak of eating from a chuckwagon box all those years ago and hearing myself question my mother about how she and her mother and Pete were provisioned from the same chuck box on their St Marys wagon trip a quarter of a century ago and on Pete snoozing there in the shade of the pickup simultaneously my admired uncle and the boy who helloed the horses at t s Toussaint and the history that went everywhere with him set me to thinking Life and people were a kind of flood around me this summer yet for all my efforts Istill was high and dry where one point of the past was FJ wrnen Toussaint climoed to his feet to visit the far side of the alfalfa stack I Rell he himself was the 372 one who hrought the topic up backatthe creek picnic onthe Fourth You are a campjack these days And an outhouse engineer and a dawn rider and a hay equipment mechanic and a scatter raker and an inquisitive I got up and followed Toussaint around the haystack Jick he acknowledged ive You are getting taJl Mac and Beth willneed a stepladder to talk to you Yeah I guess I contributed but my altitude was not what I wanted discussed As Toussaint tended to his irrigation and I to mine I asked Toussaint what can you tell me about Stanley Meixell I mean I dont know him real weJl That time up in the Two I was only lending bim a hand with his camptending is all Stanley Meixell Toussaint intoned Stanley was the ranger Whenthe national forest was put Ln Yeah I know t04t But more what I was wonderingdid he and my folks have a runin sometime I cant quite figureout What they think of Stanley But you said Toussaint You do thinking too What is ityouthink of Stanley He hadme theie I dont just know Ive never come up against anyDody like him Toussaint nodded That is Stanley he affirmed You know morethanyouthink you qo Well there I was as usual No more enlightened than when I started The chronic condition of Jick McCaskill age 14 1112 years prospects for a cure debatable 373 At least the solace of scatter raking remained to 1e Or so I thought As I say this day I have just told about was the one that stint finished off the benchland alfalfa of haying back down onthe Neon Creek rlieadows Even yet I go over and over in spell of my mind the happenings which that last was holding in store Talk about a chain of events You could raise and lower the anchor of an ocean liner on the stringof links that began to happen new Our new venue for haying wasthe old Ramsay homestead The upper place mymother and Peteboth called it by habit because it was the part of the Reese ranch farthest up Noon Creek farthest in toward were the mountains The meadows but plentiful tucked into the willowbendsof Noon Creek the way pieces of a jigsaw puzzle clasp into one Pete always left the Ramsay hay until lastbecause its twisty little fields wereso hard to In some caseshe had to driveout of sight around two or three bends of the creek to bring in enough hay for a respectable stack You spend all your damn time here going instead of doing was his unfond sentiment For me on the scatter rake though the upper place was just fine Almost any direction Isent Blanche and Fisheye prancing toward there s tood Breed Butte or the mountains for me to lean my eyes on In this close tothem theRockies took up more than half the edge of the earth which seemed only their fair proportiqn And knowing the reefs and peaks as I did I could judge where each sheep allotment was there along the mountain wall of my fathers foret Walter Kyle atop Roman Reef 374 with his sheep and his telescope Andy Gustaf son with one of the Busby hands under the middle of the reef where I had camptended him farther south Sanford Hebner in escape from his family name and situation Closer toward Flume Gulch and the North Fork whatever human improvement had replaced Canada Dan as herder of the other Busby band Lower down in the mixof timber and grass Pat Hoy and the Withrow sheep and the counting vee where my father and I talked and laughed with Doqe Already it was likegoing back to another time to think about that first day of the counting trip The upper place the old Ramsay place always presented me new prospects of thought besides its horizons though For it was here that I was boin Alec and I both in the Ramsay homestead house that still stands there today al though abandoned ever since my father quitasthe Noon Creek association rider and embarked us into the Forest Service liie I couldnt have been but a year or so old when we moved away yet Ifelt someregard for this site An allegiance even for a bond of that sort will happen when you have been the last to live at aplaGe Or so I think Gratitude that it offered a roof over yourhead for as long asit did this may be and remorse that only emptiness is yoursuccessor thele Alec and I September children native Noon Creekels And my mothers birthplace down the creekat the Reese ranch house itself Oddtothinkthat of the four ofus at the English Creek ranger station allthoseyears the place that answered to the word home in each of us only my father originated on English Creek he alone was our 375 link to Scotch Heaven and the Montana origins of the McCaskills We Americans scatter fast And something odder In aphysical sense hereat the upper place I was more Bistant from Alec than I had been all summer The Double W lay half the length of Noon Creek from where my rake now wheeled and Mentally though this advent to our mutual native ground was a kind of reunion with my Or at least with thoughts of h it While I held thereins of Blanche and Fisheye as they clopped along I wondered what saddle horse Alec might be riding When we moved the stacker from one siteto thenext I thought of Alec on the move too likely patroling Double Wfences this time of year performing his quick mending on any barbwire or post that neededit By this stage of haying Wisdom Johnson a time or two a day could be heard remembering the charms of Bouncing Betty on FirstAvenue South in Great Falls I wonderedhowmany times a week Alec was managing to ride into Gros Ventre and see Leona I wonderedwell just say I With all this new musing to be done the first day of haying the Ramsay meadows went calmly enough A Monday that was a mild day had been a cool and cloudy Sunday Wisdom Johnson I remember claimedwe now were haying so far up into the polar regions thathe might have to put his shirt qn Anyway a Monday a underway day The morning of the second Ramsay day though began unordinary I started to seeso as soon as Pony and I were coming down off the oencnland to the Reese ranch buildings My mind as usual at that 376 was sour milk soda bi8cuits anq fried eggs and venison sausage andotfter breakfast splendors as furnished by Marie but I couldnt help watching the other rider who approached the Reeses at about the time I did this of course was Clayton Hebner for as Id be descending from mybenchland route Clayton would be riding in from the Hebner place on the North Fork having come around the opposite end of bay Breed Butte from me Always Clayton was on that my father and I had seenthe two smaller Hebner jockeys trying to urge into motiqn at the outset of our counting trip and always he came plodding in at the same pace and mayoe even in the same hooftracks as the morning bef01e The first fewmornings of haying I had waved to Clayton liut received no And I didnt deserve any I ought to have known Hebners didnt go in for wavilg etiquette of greet ing was not what now had my attentiqn This particular morning Clayton across the usual distance between uslooked Looked slouchy as if he might have nodded off in the saddle Looked somehowwell the wordthatcomesto mind isdormant I had unsaddled Pony and was turning her into the pasture beside the oarn whenit became evident why Clayton Hebner didnt seem himself this mornilg He Hello there Jick came the bray of Good Help Unchristly hour of the dayto be out and ahout aint it Clayton buggered his ankle up Good Help was explaining in a fast yelp Even before the sire of the Hebner clan managed to unload hlinself from the swaybacked mare Pete had appeared in the yard with 377 an expressionthat told me ranchhouse walls did nothingto dimthe identification of Good Help Hebner Sprained the goshdamn thing when him and Melvin was grabassing around after supper last night Good Help sped on to the two of qs I tell you Pete I just dont know got into kids these days I finished for Good Help in my mind before he blared itout Yet just about the time you think you can recite every forthcoming point of conversation from a Good Help Hebner thats when hell throw you for a loqp As now when Good Help delivered himself of this Oughtnot to leave a neighbor inthe lurch though Pete So Ill take the stacker driving for you a couple days till Clayton mends up Pete looked as though hed just been offered something nasty on the end of a stiGk Butthere just was no way around the situation Someone to drive the stacker team was needed and given that 12yearold Clayton had beenperforming the job maybe an outside chance existed that Good Help could tqo Maybe Dandyn uttered Pete without meaning a letter of Lt Come on in and sit up for breakfast Garland Then Jick can sort you out on the using Kind of a racehorsey pair of bastards aint they Good Help evaluated Jocko and Pep the stacker teqm These Huh uh I reassured h n They re the oldest tamest team on the place Garland Thats why Pete uses them on the stacker 378 Horses n proclaimed Good Help as if he had just been invited to address Congress on the toptc You just never can tell about They can look logey as a preacher after a chicken dinner and goshdamn the next thing yotl know they turn theirselves One timeE Garland these two old grandmas could pull the stacker cable in their Andjust about do Come on Ill help you get them Then we got to go make Thenext development in our making of hay didnt dawn on me for quite sOIDe time Thatis I noticed only that Wisdom Johnson today had no cause to complain of coolness This was an August day with its furnace door Almost as soon as all of usgot to the hayfield at the upper place Wisdom was stripping off his shlrt and gurgling a drink of How Wisdom Johnson didit Ill never know but he drank water oftener than the rest of us onthe hay crew all together and yet never got heatsick from doing I mean an ordinary person had to be carefulaboutputting cool water inside a sweating body Pete and Perry and Clayton and I rationed our visits to the burlapwrapped water jugthat was kept in the shade of the But Wisdom had his own wRterbag bung onthe stacker frame up there where he could reach it anytime he Ahot day like this seemed to stoke both Wisdoms stacking and liis liquid consumptiqn Hed swig spit out the stream to rinse hay dust from his mouth Swig again several Adams apple swallows this time Then refreshed yell down to Pete on the 379 buckrake More hay Bring er on Possibly then it was the lack of usual exhortation from Wisdom that first tickled my attentiqn I had been going about my scatter rakingas usual thy mind here andthere and the other and only eventually did I notice the unusual silence of the hayfield Above the brushy bend of the creek between me and the stack though I could see the stacker arms and fork taking load after load up and Wisdom was there pitching hay energetically and all seemed in The contrary t didnt seep through me until I felt the need for a drink of water and reined Blanche and Fisheye around the bend to go in to the stack and get it This haystack was distinct from anyother we had put up all summer This one was hunched forward leaning like a big haycolored snownrift against frame of the More like a sidehill than a staGk In fact this one so littleresembled Wisdoms straight high style of haystack that I whoaed my team and sat to watch the procedure that was producing thisleaning tower of Pia Thestacker fork with its next cargo of hay rose slowly slowly Good Help at leisure behind the stacker tec n When the arms and the forknearedthe frame be idly called whoap eased Jocko and Pep to a stop and the hay gently plooped onto the very front of the stack adding to the forwardleaning cret Wisdom gestured vigorously towardthe back of the stack You did not haveto know pantomime to decipher thathe wanted hay flung into that neighhorhoqd Then Wisdoms pitchfork flashed and he began 380 to shove hay down fromtbe crest desperately parceling it toward the lowerslope back theJe He had made a heroic transferral of several huge pitchforkfuls when the nextstacker load hovered up and plooped exactly where the prior one Entrancing as Wisdoms struggle was I stirred myself andwent on in for my slug cf Not up to me to regulate Good Help Hebner Although it was with difficultythat I didnt make some crack when Good Help yiped to me Yessir Jick were haying now aint we From there on Wisdoms sidehill battle was a lost cause When that haystack was done or at least Wisdom called quits on it and it was time to move the stacker to the next site even Perry stopped dump raking in the field next door and for once came over to help The day Dy now was without a wisp of moving air a hot stillness growing Yet here was a haystack that gave every appearance of leaning into a Poles and props were going to oe necessary to keep this stack uprighttlrtil winter let alone into Wisdom glistenedso wet with sweat he might havejust come out of Side by side Perry and I wordlessly appraised the cattywampus haystack a little like mourners to the factthatour raking efforts had come tosucha resuit Pete had climoed off the buckrake and gained his first full view and now looked like he might be coming down with a toothac4e Pete Wisdom started in I gotto talk to yqu Somehow that doesnt surprise me said Pete Lets get the 381 stacker moved then well gab After the stacker was in place at the new site and Pete bucked in some loads as the base of the next stack he shut down the buckrake and called Wisdom over They had a session with considerable headshaking and armwaving by Wisdom Then Pete went over to Good Help and much more discussion and gesturing ensued Finally Good Help shook his head nodded spat squinted scratched and nodded again Pete settled for this and climbed on the buckrake For the next little while of stacking hay there was slightly more snap to Good Helps teamstering He now had Jocko and Pep moving as if they were only half asleep instead of sleepwalking Wisdom managed to get his back corners of the stack built good and high and it began to look as if we were haying semirespectably again Something told me to keep informed as I did my scatter raking though and gradually the story of this new stack became clear Once more hay was creeping up and up in a slope against the frame of the stacker But that was not the only slope Due to Wisdoms determined efforts to build up the back corners the rear also stood high Something new again in the history of hay a stack shaped like a gigantic saddle prominent low in the middle and loftiest at the loads softly softly Wisdom Johnson new looked like a man standing in a coulee and trying to shovel both sidehills down level 382 My own shirt was sopping just from sitting on the Wisdom surely was pouring sweat fiy tlie glassfuH T watched as he grabbed his off the frame and took adesperate swig It persuaded me that I needed to come in and visit the water Jug agaLn I disembarked from my rake just as Wisdom floundered to the exact middle of the swaybackstack and jabbed his pitchfork in asif planting a cattle Drop the next load right on that fork he shouted down to Good HeJp So saying he stalked up to the back of the haystack folded his arms and glowered down toward the pitchforktarget he had estaolished for the next volley of This I had to watch The water jug could wait I planted myself just far enough from the stack to take in the whole GoodHelp squinted scratched spat etcetera which seemed to be his formula of acknowledgment Then be twirled the ends of the reins andwhapped the rumps ofJocko Isuppose a comparison to makeis this how wouldyou react if you had spent the past hourspeacefully dozing and somebody jabbed a tliumbbetween your ribs I believe even GoodHelp was more than a little surprised at the flying start his leather message produced from Jocko and Pep Away the pair of horses Jogged at a harnessrattling pace their reins Good Help toddled aftertheteam a lot more rapidly than I ever imagined he was capable qi The cable whirred snakelike through the pulleysof the And the load of hay was going up as if it was 383 being fired from one of those Roman catapults I spun and rqn If the arms of the stacker hit the frame at that runaway velocity there was going to bestacker timber flying out the vicinity Over my shoulder though I saw it all Through some combination of stumble lurch and skid Good Help at last mallaged to rare back on with all his weight and yankedthehorses to astop Simultaneouslythe stacker arms and fork popped to a halt just inches short of the frame the whole apparatus quivering up there in the sky like a giant tuning f oik The hqy The hay was And Wisdom was so busy glowering 11e didnt realize this load was arriving to him as if lobbed by Paul Bunyqn I yelled hut anything took some time to sink in to Wisdqm His f irst hint of doom was as the hay instead of cascading down over the pitchfork GoodHelp wassupposed to be sighting on kept coming andcomingand comiflg A quarter of a ton of timothy and bluestem on a trajectory to the top of Wisdoms heqd is always 2020 Wisdomought to have humped up and accepted the Hed have had to splutter hay the next several minutes but a guy as sturdy as he was wouldnt have been hurt by the big loose wqd But I suppose to look up and see ameteorite of hay dropping on you is encugh to startle a person Wisdom in his surprise took a couple of wading s teps fackward from the falling mass And had forgotten how 384 farhack he already was onthestack That secondstep carried Wisdom to the edge at the same moment that the hayload spilled itself onto thestack Just enough of that hay flowed against Wisdom to teeter nPn The teeteripg slipped him over the brink Oh hell Iheard him say as he started to slide Every stackman knows the danger of falling from the heights of his work In Wisdoms situation earth lay in wait for him 20 feet Iielow This lent him incentive Powerful as he was the desperately Wisdomclawed his arms into the back of the haystack as he Like a man trying to swim up a waterfall even as the water sluices hiin down 11Goshdamn11 Good Help marveled somewhere behind Will you look at thatu Wisdoms armwork did slow hisdescent and meanwhile a sizable cloud of hay was pulling loose from the stack and coming down with him considerablycushioning his Asit turned out exceptfor scratched and chafed arms and chest and a faceful of hay Wisdom met the ground intact He also arrived to earth with afull head of steam all of wilich he now intendedto vent on Good Help Hebner You satchelass old son of a frigging goddamnWisdom s was a rendition I have always wished Id had time to connnit to memory An entire opera of cussing as he emerged out of the saddleback stack But IDore than Wisdoms mouth was in action he was trying to lay hands on GoodHelp GoodHelp was prudently keeping the team of horses between hiin and the stackmcin Across the horses wide backs they eyed one 385 another one way and Good Help going the other then the revere Since the stacker arms andforkstillwere inthe sky held there only by cable hitched to the team I moved in and grabbed the halters of Jocko and Pep so they would stand steaqy By now Pete had arrived on the buckrake to find his stacking crew inthis Hold everything he shouted which indeed was what the situation Pete got over and talked Wisdom away from one side of the team of horses Good Help pussyfooted away from their opposite side and I backed Jocko and Pep toward the stack to let down the arms and fork Diplomacy of major proportions now was demanded of Pete His dilemma was this If he didnt prune Good Help from the hay crew Wisdom Johnson was goingto depart soone9t Yet Pete needed to stay on somewhat civil terms with Good Help for the sake of hanging on to Clayton and the oncoming lineage of Hebner boys as a ready source of labqr Besides all that it was simply sane general policy not to get crosswise with a neighborsuch as Good Help for he could just as readilysubstitute your livestock for those poached deer hanging in his jackpines Wisdom hadstalked away to try to towel some of the chaff off himself with his shirt I hung aroundPete and Good Help I wouldnt have missedthis for the worid Garland we seem to have a problem here Pete began with sizable understatement You and Wisdqm He doesnt quite agree with the way you drive stacker team 386 even Pete I have stacked more hay than that guy has By which Good Helpmust have meant inseveral previous incarnatiots as none of us who knew him in this lifetime had ever viewed a pitchfork in his hanqs He dont know a favorwhen its done to him If hed let me place the loads the way they ought tobe he could do the stacking while setting in a goshdamn rocking chair up theie He doesnt quite see it that wqy He dont see doodlysquat aboutputting up hay that fellow I sure dont envyyou all his haystacks that are gonna tip assyturvy before winter Pete Garland somethingsgot to give Wisdom wont stackif youre going to drive The hint flew pastGood Help by aTexas mile Kind of a stubborn bozo aint he he cammiserated with Pete I was you Id of sent him down the road long sinGe gazed at Good Help as if a monumental idea hadjust been preAs indeed one hqd nI guess you re right Id better go ahead and can him Pete judiciously agreed with Good Help I gaped at Pete But he was going right on I do need to have somebody on the stack who knows what hes doing though Lucky as hell you re on hand Garland Nobody else on this crew is veteranto the stacking job like you aie What well do Ill put you up on the stack and well make some hay around here for a change huh Good Help wentas still as Lots wife and I swearhe eventurned 387 aboutas white Ordinarily nownI didnt get to hear all of the ensuing cata1ogue of excuse because I had to saunter away to keep my giggles in but this goshblamed back of mineI heard more than enoughif itllhelp you out with thatstubborn bozo I canjust head on home Peteto know thatit constituted Good Helps adieu to hayllg That night at English Creek my father and mother laughed and laughed at my retelling of the saga of Wisdom and Good Help A pair of dandies they are my father ajudged Recently he seemed to take particularpleasure in any evidence that jugheaded behavior wasnt a monopoly of the Forest ServiGe But then a further point occurred to him and he glancedat my mother She looked soberly back at I m It had occurred to her tqo She in fact was the one who now asked it Then whos going to drive thestackerteam11 Actually I confessed I 388 So that was how I went from hayings ideal job to its goddamn dullest Back and forth with that stacker team All of haying until then I had idly glanced at those little towpaths worn into the meadow out from the side of each stack we put up identical routes the exact length of the stacker cable Now it registered on me how many footsteps horse and human it took to trudge those patterns into creation The scenery meanwhile constant the rear ends of Jocko and Pep looming ahead of me like a pair of circus fat ladies bending over to tie their shoelaces Too promptly I discovered a charm of Peps which was to hoist his tail and take a dump as soon as we were hitched to watch my step or find myself that I had to remember in fresh horse apples Nor did it help my mood that Clayton with his tender ankle was able to sit on the seat of the scatter rake and do that job My scatter rake The first long hours of driving the stacker team I spent brooding about the presence of the Hebner tribe in this world I will say the stacker team job shortly cured me of too much thinking The first time I daydreamed a bit and was slow about starting the load up onto the stack Wisdom Johnson brought me out of it by shouting down Hey Jick Whistle or sing or show your thing I was tempted to part Wisdoms hair with that particular load of hay but I forebore Maybe my stacker team mood was contagious Suppertime of the 389 second day when I got back to English Creek I found my mother frowning over the weeks Gleaner Whats up I asked her Nothing she said and didnt convince me When she went to the stove to wrestle with supper and I had washed up I zeroed in on the article shed been making a mouth at It was one on the Random page Phantom Woman When Fire Ran On The Mountain Editors note The fire season is once again upon us and lightning needs no help from the carelessness of man It is just 10 years ago that the Phantom Woman Mountain conflagration provided an exarnple of what happens when fire gets loose in a big way We reprint the story as a reminder When in the woods break your matches after blowing them out crush cigarette butts and douse all campfires Forest Service crews are throwing everything in the book at the fire on Phantom Woman mountainbut so far the roaring blaze has thrown it all back The inferno is raging in upanddown country near the headwaters of the North Fork of English Creek about 20 miles west of Gros Ventre Reports 390 from Valier and Conrad say the column of smoke can be seen from those communities How many acres of forest have been consumed is not known It is certain the loss is the worst in the Two Medicine National Forest since the record fire season of 1910 One eyewitness said the crews seemed to be bringing the fire under control until late yesterday afternoon Then the upper flank of the fire broke loose and started going across that mountain as fast as a man can run HT Gisborne fire research specialist for the US Forest Service at Missoula explained the blowup phenomenon Ordinarily the front of a forest fire advances like troops in skirmish formation pushing ahead faster here slower there according to the timber type and fuels but maintaining a practically unbroken front Even when topography fuels and weather result in a crown fire the sheet of flames leaps from one tree crown to the next at a relatively slow rate from onehalf to one mile an hour But when such runs throw spots of fire ahead of the advancing front the spots burn back to swell the main front and add to the momentum of 391 the rising mass of heat Literally a blowup of the front of the fire may then happen No word has been received of casualties in the Phantom Woman fire although reports are that some crews had to flee for their lives when the blowup occurred When my father came in for supper my mother liberated the Gleaner from me and handed it to him saying Mac you might as well see this Meaning you might as well see it before our son the asker starts in on you about it The headline stopped him Bill Reinking always got in touch with him about any story having to do with the Two Medicine National Forest Whys this in the paper my father now demanded of the world at large Its been ten years Mac my mother told him Ten years ago this week He read it through His eyes were intent his jaw was out as if stubborn against the notion that fire could happen in the Two Medicine National Forest When he tossed the yleaner aside though he said only Doesnt time fly The next day two developments I took some guilty pleasure at the first of these Not long before noon Clayton dropped one wheel of the scatter rake into a 392 ditch that was closer than hed noticed and the impact broke one of the brackets that attaches the dumping mechanism to the rake frame Clayton himself looked considerably jarred although I dont know whether mostly by the jolt of the accident or the dread that Pete would fire him for it But Pete being Pete he instead said These things happen Clayton Well cobble it with wire until we can get a weld done on it And once I got over my secret satisfaction about the superiority of my scatter raking to Claytons I was glad Pete didnt come down hard on the boy Being a son of Good Help Hebner seemed to me punishment enough for anybody Then at the end of the workday as Pony and I came down the benchland to the ford of English Creek I saw a second Forest Service pickup parked beside my fathers outside the ranger station I figured the visitor might be Cliff Bowen the young ranger from the Indian Head district just of us and it was When I stepped in to say hello I learned Cliff had been to headquarters in Great Falls and had come by with some fire gear for my father And with some rangerly gripes he was sharing as well Normally Cliff Bowen was mild as milk but his headquarters visit left him pretty well steamed Mac Sipe asked me how things are going Sipe was Ken Sipe the superintendent of the Two Medicine National Forest 11I told smokechasers anl him about as good as could be expected but we need more fire guards July arrl nYN August had stayed so hot arrl dangerous that rangers had been permitted to hire sorre fire manpower but only enough as my father had said to give us a taste 393 Howd that go over with him my father wondered About like a fart in church He told me its Missoula policy Hold down on the hiring on these eastside forests Goddamn it Mac I dont know what the Majors thinking of This forest is as dry as paper We get one good lightning storm in the mountains and well have fires the whole sonofabitching length of the Two Maybe the Majors got it all arranged with upstairs so there isnt going to be any lightning the rest of the summer Cliff Yeah maybe But if any does get loose I hope to Christ it aims for the rivets on the Majors hip pocket My father couldnt help but laugh You think snag strikes are trouble Figure how long the Majord smolder Two developments I said back there Amend that to three As I led Pony to her pasture for the night the heat brought out sweat on me just from that little walk When I reached the house the thermometer in our kitchen window was catching the western sun 92 it read The hot heavy weather was back The kind of weather that invites lightning storms But all we got that night was a shower a dab of drizzle When I climbed out of bed in the morning I debated whether Petes hay would be too wet to stack today So that I wouldnt make my ride for nothing I phoned the Reese ranch Pete thinks itll be dry enough by middle of the morning Maries voice told me Come on for breakfast I have sourdough 394 hotcakes It turned out that the sourdough hotcakes were the only real gain of the morning for our hay crew We took our time at the breakfast table and then did a leisurely harnessingup of our teams and made no hurry of getting to the Ramsay places hayfields and still Perry and Bud and Wisdom had a lot of smoke time while Pete felt of the hay and gandered at the sky Finally Pete said Hell lets try it We would do okay for a while put up a dozen or so loads then here would come a sun shower Just enough moisture to shut us down Then wed hay a little more and another sun shower would happen For a rancher trying to put up hay that is the most aggravating kind of day there can be Or as Pete put it during one of these sprinkly interruptions Goddamn it if youre gonna rain rain By about 2 oclock and the fourth or fifth startandstop of our stacking he had had enough The hell with it Lets head for home I naturally anticipated an early return to English Creek and started thinking about where I might go fishing for the rest of the afternoon My theory is the more rotten the weather the better the fishing But as I was unharnessing Jocko and Pep Pete came out of the house and asked Jick how do you feel about a trip to town Inasmuch as we were rained out anyway he elaborated I might just as well take the scatter rake in to Grady Tiltons garage and 395 get the broken bracket welded stay overnight at the Heaneys and in the morning drive the repaired rake back here to the ranch I checked all this out with headquartersmeaning my rnotherand she said itd be okay Sounds good to me I told Pete The full fact was after the days of trudging back and forth behind the stacker team it sounded like an expedition to Africa So I set off for Gros Ventre about midafternoon Roving scatter raker Jick McCaskill hitting the road even if the route only was to town and back The first couple of miles almost flew by for it was remarkable what a pair of steppers Blanche and Fisheye now seemed to me speed demons in comparison to Jocko and Pep My thoughts were nothing special Wondering what Ray Heaney would have to report Mulling the rest of the summer Another week or so of haying The start Of only 30 days away And my 15th birthday one day less than that I ask you how is it that after the Fourth of July each summer time somehow speeds up I like to believe that even while curlicues of this sort are going on in my head the rest of me is more or less on the job Aiming that scatter rake down the Noon Creek road I took note of Dill Egans haystacks which looked to me like poor relations of those Wisdom built Way over on the tan horizon to the northeast I could 396 see specks that would be Double W cattle and wondered where Alec was riding or fencefixing today And of course one of the things a person always does a lot of in Montana is watching other peoples weather All that sky and horizon around you there almost always is some atmospheric event to keep track of At the top of the county roads rise from Dill Egans place I studied a dark anvil cloud which was sitting over the area to the northwest of me My father was not going of his forest and I told myself the looks of that one hovering along the edge Ramsay hayfield is going to have itself a bath In a few more minutes I glanced around again though and found that the cloud wasnt sitting over the Ramsay place It was on the move Toward Noon Creek and me A good thing I was bright enough to bring my slicker along on the rake the coat was going to save me from some wet But the next time rain was pushed off my mental agenda The cloud was bigger blacker and closer A whole hell of a lot closer It also was rumbling now like it was the engine of the entire sky That may sound fancy but view it from my eyes at the time a dark block of storm with pulses of light coming out of it like flame winking from firebox doors And even as I gawked at it a jagged rod of lightning stabbed from the cloud to the earth Pale lightning nearer white than yellow The kind a true electrical storm employs 397 As I have told I am not exactly in love with lightning anyway Balling the reins in both my hands I slapped Blanche and Fisheye some encouragement across their rumps Hyaah you two Lets go Which may sound but try sitting on a tenfoot expanse of metal rake with lightning approaching and then prescribe to me what you would have done Go we did at a rattling pace for the next several minutes I did my best to count distance on the thunder but it was that grumbling variety that lets loose another thump before youve finished hearing the one before My eyes rather than my ears had to do the weather forecasting and they said Blanche and Fisheye and the rake and I were not going as fast as the stormcloud was traveling or growing or whatever the hell it was doing The route ahead stretched on and on for immediately after coming up out of Dill Egans place the Noon Creek road abandons the bottomland and arrows along the benchland between Noon Creek and English Creek until it eventually hits the highway north of Gros Ventre Miles of country as exposed as a table top I tell you a situation like that reminds a person that skin is damn thin shelter against the universe One thing the steady thunder and the pace of the anvil cloud did tell me was that I somehow had to abandon that road Find a place to pull in and get myself and my horses away from this tenfoot lightning rod on wheels The question was where Along the English Creek road Id have had no problem within any little way there 398 a ranch could be pulled into for shelter But around here the Double W owned everything and wherever there did happen to be a turnoff into one of the abandoned sets of Noon Creek ranch buildings the Double W kept the gate padlocked against fishermen scan As I verified for myself by halting my team for a the gate into the old Nansen place A lack of choices can make your mind up for you in a hurry I whapped Blanche and Fisheye again and on down the county road we clattered heading for a high frame of gateposts about threequarters of a mile off The main gate into the Double w It took forever but at last we pulled up at that gateframe and the Double W turnoff From the crosspiece supported by the big gatepoststhe size and height of telephone poles they really werehung the sign WW RANCH WENDELL MEREDICE WILLIAMSON The sign was creaking a little the wind starting to stir in front of the storm Neither the sign nor the wind I gave a whit about just then What I had forgotten was that this turnoff into the Double W had a cattleguard built in there between the gateposts A pit overlaid with a grill of pipes which vehicles could cross but hoofed creatures such as cattle couldnt Hoofed creatures such as cattle and horses To put Blanche and Fisheye through here I would have 399 to open the barbwire livestock gate beside the cattleguard You know what I was remembering GODaMIGHTy get aWAY from thatStanleys cry as I approached the wire gate at the cabin during our carnptending trip You happen to be touching that wire and lightning hits that fence This corning rumblebelly of a storm made that June one look like a damp washcloth Every time I glanced in its direction now lightning winked back And nowhere around this entrance to the Double W was there a stick of wood not one sole single goddamn splinter with which to knock the hoop off the gate stick and flip the wire gate safely aside Holy H Hell Sitting here telling this all the distance of years between that instant and now I can feel again the prickling that came across the backs of my hands the sweat of dismay on its way up through my skin there Grant me three moments which could be erased from my life and that Double W gate scene would be one I wiped my hands against my pants Blanche swished her tail and Fisheye whinnied They maybe were telling me what I already knew Delay was my worst possible behavior for that storm was growing nearer every second that I stood there and stewed I wiped my hands again And jumped at the gate as if in combat against it One arm grappling around the gatepost the other arm and hand desperately working the wire hoop up off the gatestickoh yes sure this gate was one of those snug obstinate bastards I needed to mightily hug the stick and post together to gain enough slack for the hoop to loosen Meanwhile 400 every place my body was touching a strand of barbwire I could feel a kind of target line ready to sizzle as if I was trussed up in electrical wiring and somebody was about to throw the switch I suppose in a fraction of what it takes to tell about it I wrestled that gate open and slung it wide Yet it did seem an immense passage of time And I wasnt on easy street yet Blanche and Fisheye I have to say were taking all of this better than I was but even so they were getting a little nervous about the storms change in the air and the loudening thunder Okay here we go now nothing to it here we go I soothed the team and started them through the gate I could have stood some soothing myself for the scatter rake was ten feet wide and this gate was only about eleven Catch a rake wheel behind a gatepost and you have yourself a first class hungup mess In my case I then would have the rake in contact with the barbwire fence inviting lightning right up the seat of my pants while I backed and maneuvered the rake wheel out of its bind Never have I aimed anything more carefully than that wide scatter rake through that justwideenough Double W gateway We squeaked through Which left me with only one more anxious act to do To close the gate for there were cattle in this field Even if they were the cattle of the damn Double W even if it mattered nothing to me that they got out and scattered to Tibetif you have been brought up in Montana you close a gate behind you 401 So I ran back and did the reverse of the wrestling thatd opened the gate Still scared spitless about touching that wire Yet maybe not quite as scared as when Id first done it for I was able to say to myself all the while what in the hell have I done to deserve this dose of predicament Again on the rake I broke all records of driving that Double W approach road down from the benchland to where the ranch buildings were clustered on the north side of Noon Creek Across the plank bridge the rake rumbled my thunder against the storms thunder and I sighted refuge The Double W barn In minutes I had my team unhitchedleaving the scatter rake out by a collection of old machinery so that lightning at least ensconcing would have to do some sorting to find itand in barn stalls They were lathered enough that I unharnessed them and rubbed them dry with a gunny sack In fact I looked around for the granary went over there and brought back a hatful of Double W oats to and Fisheye as their reward Now I could draw a breath and look around for my own benefit The Double W had buildings and more buildings This barn was huge and the twostory white Williamson house across the yard could have housed the governor of Montana You would think this was ranch enough for anybody yet Wendell Williamson actually owned another one at least as big as this The Deuce wits cattle brand was down in the Highwood Mountains between Great Falls and Lewistown a hundred or more miles from here More distance than Id been in my whole life and Wendell goddamn Williamson possessed both ends of it Be that as it may the Double W was now my port in the storm and I had better make my presence known1f No one was in sight it would take a little while for the rain to bring in Alec and the other riders and the hay crew from the range and the hayfield But somebody was bound to be in the house and I hurried over to there before I had to do it during the storm I knocked at the front door The door opened and Meredice Williamson was standing there smiling and saying Yes Lo Mrs Williamson I put Blanche and Fisheye in your barn That seemed to be double Dutch to her But she smiled on and cormnended That was good of you Im sure Wendell will be pleased deliverl I sought to correct her impression that Blanche and Fisheye was involved here Well no theyll only be there until it clears up I mean what it is I was driving my scatter rake to town and the storm started coming and I had to head in here on account of lightning so I unhitched my team and put them in the barn there I hope thats all right Im sure it must be she acceded pretty plainly because she had no idea what else to say Meredice Williamson was a city womana lawyers widow it was saidwhom Wendell met and married in 403 California a few winters before The unkind view of her was that shed had too much sun on the brain down there But I believe the case honestly was that because Meredice Williamson only came north to spend summers pt the Double W she never got clued in to the Two country never quite caught up with its rhythms of season and livelihood and lore At least standing there within the weathered doorway in her yellow sun frock and with her graying hair in per she looked much like a visitor to her own ranch house Yet maybe Meredice Williamson was not as vague as the general estimate of her for she now pondered my face a moment more and then asked Are you Beth McCaskills other boy Which wasnt exactly my most preferred phrasing of it But she did have genealogical fact on her side So I bobbed yes and contributed Jick Alecs brother Wendell thinks highly of Alec she confided as if I gave a hoot in hell about Mr Double Ws opinion So far as I could see Wendell Williamson was a main contributor to Alecs mental delinquency encouraging him in his damn cowboy notions The summers sunder of my family followed a faultline which led to this doorstep Fair is fair though and I couldnt really blame Meredice Williamson for Wendells doings Innocent as a bluebird on a manure pile this lady seemed to be Thus I only said back Yeah So I savvy Just then the leading edge of rain hit splatting drops the size of quarters on the flagstones of the walk Meredice Williamson peered past me in surprise at the blackening sky It looks like a shower she mustered Wouldnt you like to step in I was halftempted On the other hand I figured she wouldnt have the notion of what to do with me once I was in there Furnish me tea and ladyfingers Ask me if I would care for a game of Chinese checkers No thats okay I declined Ill wait in the bunkhouse Alec likely will show up there pretty quick Ill shoot the hooey with him until the rains over and then head on to town Here Meredice Williamsons expression showed that she was unsure what hooey was or why we would shoot it In a hurry I concluded Anyway thanks for the borrow of your barn Youre quite welcome Jake she was saying as I turned and sprinted across the yard The rain was beginning to pelt in plentiful drops now pocking the dust Flashes of light at the south edge of the storm and the immediate rumbles made me thankful again that I was in off the rake even if the haven was the Double W Strange to be in a bunkhouse when its residents are out on the job Like one of those sea tales of stepping aboard a ship where everything is intact sails set and a meal waiting on the galley stove but the crew has vanished Any bunkhouse exists only to shelter a crew There is no feel of it as a home for anybody although even as I say that I realize many ranch hands spent their lives in a bunkhouse Alec himself was a fulltimer here and would be until he and Leona tied their knot Even so a bunkhouse to me seems a place you can put up with for a season but that would be enough If you are unaccustomed to a bunkhouse the roomful of beds is a medley of odors Of tobacco in three incarnations handrolled cigarettes snoose and chewing tobacco The last two in fact had a permanent existence in the spit cans beside about half the bunks These I took special note of not wanting to kick one of them over Of too many bodies and not enough baths yet I wonder why it is that we now think we have to deodorize the smell of humanness out of existence Of ashes and creosote the presence of an elderly stove and stovepipe All in all the scent of men and what it takes them to lead the ranch hands life I gandered around to try and figure out which bunk was Alecs An easy enough mystery The corner bunk with the snapshot of Leona on the wall above the pillow Naturally the picture deserved a closer lookff rt showed Leona on a horse in a show ringthat would be Tollie Zanes during one of his horse salesand wearing a lady Stetson and leather chaps And a smile that probably fused the camera But I managed to get past the top of Leona to where something else was tugging my eyes Down the length of her chaps something was spelled out in tooled letters with silver spangles between I moved in for a closer look yet my nose almost 406 onto the snapshot and I was able to make out M 0 N T A N A Well that wasnt the message that ordinarily would come to mind from looking along Leonas leg But it was interesting I could hear voices and men began trooping in The hay crew at the tail end of them Alec who looked flabbergasted to see me sitting on his bunk Jicker what in blazes he started as he strode over to me I related to him my scatter rake situation and he listened keenly although he didnt look perceptibly happier with my presence As soon as the rain lets up Ill head on to town I assured him yourself Yeah well home I guess Now to my surprise my brother seemed short of anything more to say He was saved from having to by the arrival of the Double W foreman Cal Petrie and the other two riders dder guys named Thurl Everson and Joe Henty Both had leather gloves and fencing pliers so I imagined they were glad to be in away from barbwire for a while too perched Cal Petrie spotted the bunk beside Alec nodded hello and steered over to ask Looking for a job He knew full well I wasnt but as foreman it was his responsibility to find out just what brought me here Again I explained the scatter rakelightning situation and Cal nodded once more A stroke of that could light you up like a Christmas tree all right Make yourself to home Alec can introduce you around Then1 Cal announced generally I got to go to town after supper for some sickle heads for the mowers and I can take two of you jaspers in with me in the pickup Ill only be in there an hour or so and you got to be ready to come home when I say No staying in there to drink the town dry in other words So cut cards or Indian rassle or compare dicks or however you want to choose but only two of you are going And he went off into the room he had to self at the far end of the bunkhouse In a hay crew such as the Double Ws there were ten or a dozen guys putting up two stacks at once and what struck me as Alec made me known to them was that three of the crew were named Mike A gangly one called Long Mike and a mower man naturally called Mike the Mower and then one who lacked either of those distinctions and so was called Plain Mike The riders who had come in with Cal Petrie I already knew Thurl and Joe Likewise the choreboy old Dolph Kuhn one of those codgers who get to be as much a part of a ranch as its ground and grass So I felt acquainted enough even before somebody chimed out 408 What are you another one of the famous fistfighting McCaskills Alecs flooring of Earl Zane at the Fourth of July dance was of course the natural father of that remark No Im thecut and shoot type I cracked back When the trouble starts I cut through the alley and shoot for home You just never know That joke had gray whiskers and leaned on yayhoos a cane but it drew a big laugh from the Double so There followed some more comment probably for the fortieth time about how Alec had whopped Earl and innumerable similar exploits performed in the past by various of this crew Youd have thought the history of boxing had taken place in that bunkhouse But I was careful not to contribute anything further The main rule when you a join a crew even if its only for the duration ofJrainstorm is to listen more than you talk Alec still didnt look overjoyed that I was on hand but I couldnt help that I didnt order up the damn electrical storm which still was rumbling and crashing around out there So I offered as an opener what do you know for sure Enough to get by on Alec allJied Been doing any calf roping No That seerre d to take care of the topic of calf Some silence then Alec hazarded HCMs the going at uwe ve pretty close to got it A few more days left HCM re tooy doing here More like a couple of weeks left I guess And there went the topic of hayiq Alec ani I just 409 sat back and listened for a little to where the discussion had now turned the pair of slots for town Some on to see the glorie9 of Gros Ventre on a Saturday night This was standard bunkhouse grouse though If Cal had said the whole shebang of them could go to towrr with him thered have been grumbling that he hadnt offered to buy them the first round of drinks as well No the true issue was just beginning to come out more than half the hay crew six or so guys considered themselves the logical town candidates The variety of reasoningthe awful need for a haircut a bet to be collected from a guy who was going to be in the Medicine Lodge only this very night even a potential toothache that necessitated preventive remedies from the drugstorewas remarkably wellrehearsed This Double W bunch was the kind of crew as the saying went who began on Thursday to get ready on Friday to go to town on Saturday to spend Sunday Long Mike and Plain Mike and a sort of a gorilla of a guy who I figured must be one of the two stackmen of this gang were among the yearners for town Plain Mike surprised me by being the one to propose that a game of cards settle the matter But then you the just never know who in a crew will turn out to rider The proposal itself eliminated the big stackman Hell with it I aint lost nothing in that burg anyway At the time I thought his sporting blood was awfully anemic It has since dawned on me that he could not readcould not tell the cards apart 410 Inasmuch as Plain Mike had efficiently whittled off one contender the other four felt more or less obliged to go along with a card game We need an honest banker Plain Mike solicited Youre talkjng contradictions somebody called out Damn I am at that Honest enough that we cant catch him will do Hey there Alecs brother How about you being the bank for us Well I dont know What are you going to play Pitch said Plain Mike What else is there That drew me Pitch is the most perfect of card games It excels poker in that there can be more than one winner during each hand and cribbage in that it doesnt take an eternity to play and rummy and hearts in that judgment is more important than the cards you are dealt and stuff like canasta and pinochle cant even be mentioned in the same breath with pitch I guess I could I assented Until the rain lets up It still was raining like bath time on Noahs ark Pull up a stump invited Plain Mike nodding toward a spare chair beside the stove Well show you pitch as she is meant to be played Uh huh at least you will I thought to myself as I added my presence to the circle of card players But I will say this for yayhoos the Double W they played pitch the classic wayhigh low game jack jick joker It would just surprise you how many people go through life under the delusion that pitch ought to be played 411 without a joker in the deck which is a skimpy damned way of doing it and how many others are just as dim in wanting to play with two jokers which is excessive and confusing My job of banker didnt amount to all that much Just being in charge of the box of Diamond wooden matches and paying out to each player as many matches as hed made points or taking matches back if he went set Truth be told I could have kept score more efficiently with a pencil and sheet of paper and Alec simply could have done it in his head But these Double W highrollers wanted to be able to squint around the table and count for themselves how much score everybody else had From the very first hand when the other players were tuning up with complaints like Is this the best you can deal a mess like this and Plain Mike simply bid three in them things called spades the and led with queen it was worth a baccalaureate degree in the game of pitch to watch Plain Mike He bid only when he had one sure point ace for high or deuce for low with some other point probable among his cards so that when he did bid it was as good as made But during a hand when anybody else had the bid he managed to run with some point jack or jick or joker for himself or at leastthis a real art of pitchhe managed to sluff the point to somebody besides the bidder I banked and admired While the other cardsters scores gyrated up and down with every hand Plain Mike added a wooden match or two to his total Around us the rest of the crew was carrying on conversation If you can call it that There is no place like a bunkhouse for 412 random yatter One guy will grouch about how the eggs were cooked for breakfast and another will be reminded of a plate of beans he ate in Pocatello in 1922 Harness the gab gas of the average house and youd an inexhaustible fuel By now Alec looking restless had come over and joined me in watching the card game This was certainly a more silent brother than Id ever been around before Maybe it had something to do with his surroundings this hay crew he and the other riders now had to share the bunkhouse with Between checking out the window on the progress of the rain and banking the pitch game I started mulling what it would be like to work in this hay crew instead of Petes If say ranches were swapped under Alec and me him up the creek at the Reese place as hed been at my age and me here at the Gobble Gobble You Some direct comparison of companions was possible Wisdom Johnson was an obvious choice over the gorilla of a guy who was one of the Double W stackrnen and a rangy man called Swede who more than likely was the other one A possible advantage I could see to the gorilla was what he might have inflicted on Good Help Hebner for trying to drown him in hay but that was wishful thinking Over on the conversation side of the room Mike the Mower looked somewhat more interesting than Bud Dolson He was paying just enough attention to the pair of storiers not to seem standoffish His bunk was the most neatly made likely showing he had been in the army All in all though Mike the Mower showed more similarity to Bud than difference Mower men were their own nationality 413 From how they had been razzing one another about quantities of hay moved three of the five pitch playersPlain Mike and Long Mike and a heavyshouldered guywere the horse buckrakers I was pretty sure how they shaped up on the job The heavyshouldered guy who looked like a horseman was the best buckraker Long Mike was the slowest And Plain Mike did just enough more work than Long Mike to look better A couple of younger guys around Alecs age but who looked about a fraction as bright likely were the stacker team drivers in this outfit Then a slouchy elderly guy in a khaki shirt and a oneeyed oneI suppose it doesnt say much for my own haying status that I was working down through this Double W crew getting to the bunch rakers and whoever the scatter raker was when the phone jangled at the far end of the room The ring of that phone impressed me more than anything else about the Double W had yet I mean there was no stipulated reason why there couldnt be a telephone in a bunkhouse But at the time it seemed a fairly swanky idea Cal Petrie stepped out of his room to answer it When he had listened a bit and yupped an answer he hung up and looked over toward where Alec and I were on the rim of the card game Come on up for supper with us the foreman directed at me Give the mud a little more chance to dry out that way Cal declaimed this as if it was his own idea but I would have bet any money as to who was on the other end of that phone line Meredice Williamson Not long after the supper bell sounded the end of the card gruneo Theheavyshouldered guy had the highest score and yes Plain Mike had the next Now that they were the townbound pair they received a number of imaginative suggestions ofentertainment they mightseek in there as the crowd of us sloshed over to the kitchen door of the houe While everybody scraped mud off their feet and trooped on in I hung back with Alec to see what the table lineup was going to be Jick hebegan but didnt go on with whatever he had in mindo Instead See you after supper he said andstepped into the house with me followingo The meal was in the sunnner room a kind of windowed porch along the side of the house long enough to hold a table for a crew this size I of course did know that even at a place like the Double w family and crew ate togethero If the King of England had owned Noon Creek benchland instead of Scottish moors probably even he would have had to go along with the ranch custom of everybody sitting down to refuel So I wasnt surprisedtosee Wendell Williamson sitting at the headof the tabieo Meredice sat at his right and the old choreboy Dolph Kuhn next to hero At Wendells left was a vacancy which I knew wouldbe the cooks place and nextto that Cal Petrie seated himselfo All five of them had chairs then backless benches filled the rest of both sides of the table which was about twenty feet longo I felt vaguely let downo It was a setup about like any other ranchs only bigger I suppose I expected the Double W to have something special like a throneforWendell Williamson instead of a straightback kitchen chatr Alec and Joe and Thurl as ranch regulars took their places next to the table elite and the hay crew began filling in the rest of the table to the far endo In fact at the far end there was a kitchen stool improvised as a seat and Meredice Williamsons smile and nod told me it was my placeo This I had not dreamt ofo FacingWendell Williamson down the length of the Double W supper tableo He now acknowledged me by saying Company Nuhhuh Quite a way to come for a free meal young fellowo Beforethinking I said back Everybody says theres no cooking like theDouble Wso That caused a lot of facial expressions along the table and I saw Alec peerat me rather firmlyo But Wendell merely said Nuhhuh againthat nuhhuh of his was a habit I would think anybody with sufficient money would pay to have brokenand took a taste of his cup of coff To me Wendell Williamson always looked as if hed been made by the sackftJL Sacks of what I wont go intoo But just everything about him girth shoulders arms even hi fingers somehow seemed fuller than was natural as if he always was slightly swolleno Wendells head particularly stood out in this way because his hair had retreated about halfway back and left allthat face to loom outo And the other odd thing up there was what remained of Wendells hair was thick and curly and coalblacka real stand of hair there at the rear of that big moonhead like a sailor might wear a watchcap pushed way backo 416 The cook came in fromthe kitchen with a bowl of gray gravy and handed it to Wendella She was a gaunt woman sharp cheekbones beakof a noeo Her physiognomy was a matter of interest and apprehension to mea The general theory is that a thin cook is a poor idea why isnt she more enthusiastic about her own grub Plain Mike was sitting at my left and at my right was a scowling guywhod been one of the losers in the pitch As I have always liked to keep abreast of things culinary I now asked Plain Mike in an undertone Isthis the cook from Havre No hell shes This ones from up at Lethbridge What my mother would have commented danced to mind So Wendell Williamson has to import them from Canada now does he Im Not Surprised Ikept that to myself but thescowler on my right had overheard my question and muttered She aint Canadian though kLdo Shes a Hungrariqno She is To me the cook didnt look conspicuously foreign a You bet o She leaves you hungrier than when you came to the table I made a polite hehhehheh to that and decided Id better focus on the meal The first bowl to reach me contained a concoction Ive never known the actual name of but in my own mind I always dub Tomato Smuh Canned tomatoes heated up with little dices of bread dropped ino You sometimes get this as a side dish in caf es when the cook has run out of all other ideas about vegetablesa Probably the Lunchery in Gros 417 Ventre served it four days a weeka In any case Tomato Smush is a remarkable recipe in that it manages to wreck both the tomatoes and the breqda Out of I spooned a dab onto my platea And next loaded up with mashed potatoesa Hard for any cook to do something drastic to mashed potatoesa The gravy though lacked salt and sotJL Then along came a platter of fried liver a This suited me fine as I can dine on liver even when it isovercooked and tough as this wqsa But I have observed in life that there is no middle ground about liver When I passed the platter to the guy on my right he mumbled something about Lethbridge leather again and his proved to be the majority view atthe table There was some conversation at the head of the table mostly between Wendell and the foreman Cal about the unfairness of being rainedout at this stage of hayinga In light of what followed I see now that the rainstorm was largely responsible for Wendells moqd Not that Wendell Williamson ever needed a excuse to be grumpy so far as I could tell9 but this suppertime he was smarting around his walleta If the rain had startedbefore noon and washed out the haying hed have had this to pay crew for only half a dqyo But since the rain came in theafternoon he was layingout a full days wages for not afull days worko I tell you there can be no one more morose than a rancher having to pay a hay crew to watch rain come down Anyway the bleak gaze of Wendell Williamson eventuallyfound its way down thelength of the table to To my surprise since I didnt 418 think anybodys welfare matteredto him but his own Wendell asked me Hows your folks Realgoodo Wendell took a mouthful of coffee casting a look at the cook as he set down his Then his attention was back on me I hear your mother gave quite a talk the day of the Fourtho Well what the hello If Wendell goddamn Williamson wanted to tap histoe to that tune I was game to partner him The McCaskills of this world maybe dont own mills and mines and all the land in sight as some Williamson back in history had managed to grab but we were born with Shessure had a lot of good comments on it I declared with enthusiam Alec was stirring in his seat trying to follow all this but hes missedMoms speech by being busy with his roping horse No this field of engagement was mine alone People tell her it brought back the old days when there were all those other ranches around here The days of BenEnglish and those What Wendell would have responded beyond that I will never know for Mered ice Williamson smiled down the table in my direction and then said to Wendell Ben Engliho What an interesting name I have always thougbto Ir Double W didnt conspicuously seem to thinkso ButMeredice sallied right on Was he do you think Was he what retorted Wendell Englisho Do you suppose 11r o English was of English extraction Meredice how in Wendell stopped himself and some more sour coffeeo He mightve been Swedish for all I knowo It would be more fitting if hewere English shepersisted Fitting Fit what It would be more fittingto the memory of the man and his times She smiled toward me agaLn To those old dayso Now she looked somewhereover my head and Plain Mikes and the heads of all of us at our end of the table and she recited Take of English earth as much As either hand may rightly clutcho In the taking of it breathe Prayer for all who lie beneath Then Meredice Williamson dipped her fork and tried a dainty bite of Tomato Smush All around the table though every other fork had stopped Even mineo I dont know maybe Kiplingout of the blue would have that effect on any group of diners not just hay handso But in any case there was a mulling silenceas Wendell contemplated Meredice and therestof us contemplated the Double W boss and his wifeo Not even a nuhhuh out of Wendeilo Finally Cal Petrie turnedtoward me and asked9 Hows that power buckrake of Petes working out Real good I saido Would somebody pass the liver please And that pretty much was thestoryof supper at the great DoubleW 420 Alec walked with me to the barnto help harness Blanche and Fisheyeo Hestill wasnt much Nor for that matter wasIo Id hadabout enough Double Wand brooding brother and was looking forward to getting to towno Something thoughsomethingkeptat me as we started harnessing It hadbeen circling in the back of my mind ever since the hay crew clomped into the bunkhouse that af ternoqn Alec came in with them Cal Petrie and the riderswho had been fixing fence made their appearance a few minutes afterthato I maybeslow but I usually get thereo Alec I asked across the horses Alec what havethey got you doing On the far side of Blanche the sound of harnessing stopped for an instanto Thenresumed I said what have they Iheardyou came my brothers voiceo Im helpingout with the hayingo I figured thqto Which job Silence I said which Raking You cannot know with what struggle I resisted popping out the next logical question Dump or scatter Yet I already knew the answero I did indeedo The old slouchy guy in the khaki shirt and the oneeyed one they were plodding dump rakers if I had ever seen the specieso And that left just one hayfield job unaccounted fqr My brother the calfroping caballero was doing the exact same thing 421 in life I wasriding a scatter I did some more buckling and adjusting on Fisheyeo Debating with myselfo After all Alec was my brothero If I couldnt talk straight from the shoulder with him who could I Alec this maybe isnt any of my business but Jick when did that detaileverstop you Whats on your mind besides your hat Are you sure you want to stay onhere More than this summer Imean Thisplacedoesnt seem to me anything so specialo So youre lining up with Mom and Dad are youa Alec didnt soundsurprised as if the rank of opinion against him was like one of the sides in choosing up to play softballa He also didnt sound as if any of us were going to alter his thinking What is there a lawthat sayssomewherethat Ivegotto go to collegeZ No its just that youd be good at it and Everybody seems awful damnsure about that Jick Im already doing something Im good at if I do say so my own self a Im as good a hand with cattle as Thurl or Joe or anybody else they ever had hereo So why doesnt that count for anything Huh Answer me thata Why cant I stay on here in the Two country and do a decent job of what I wantto instead of traipsing off to goddamn college For the first time since hestepped into the bunkhouse and C8ught sight of me Alec came alivea Hestood now in front of Blanche holdingher haltered heado But looking squarely at me as I stood in front of Fisheye The tall and blueeyed and flamehaired Alec 22 of our English Creek years the Alec who faced life as if it was always goig to deal him aceso I tried again maybe to see if I was understanding my brothers wor4so Christamfghty though Alecthey havent even got you doing whatyou want to do here You hired on as a ridero Whyre you goingto let goddamnWendelldowhatever he wants with you Alec shook his heado You dosound like the folks woulda Im trying to sound like myself is all What is it about the damn lifehere that you think isso great My brotherheld his look on Not angry not even stubborn And none of that abstracted glaze of earlier inthe stinnner as though only halfseeing This was Alec to the full the one who answered me now Thatits my owna Well yeah I guessitis was all I could manage to For it finally hadstruck me This answer that had popped out of Alec as naturally as a multiplication sum this was the futureo So much did my brother wanttobeon his own in life he would put up with a bad choice of his own whatever the Double W heaped on him if it came to thatrather than give in tosomebody elses better plan for hLtn Ever since the night of the supper argument our parents thought theywerecontending with Alecs cowboy phase or withLeona or the combination of the twoa I now knew otherwise What they were up against was the basic Alec Jick he was saying to me do me a favor about all this okay 423 What is it Dont say anything to the folkso About me not riding just now He somewhere found a grin although a puny oneo About me following in your footsteps as a scatter rakero They have a low enough opinion of me recentlyo He held the grin so determinedly it began to hurt me So will you do that for me Yeaho I willo Okay Alec let out a lot of breath We better get you hooked up and on your way or youll haveto roll Grady out of bed to do the weldingo One morething I had to find out though As I got up on the seat of the scatter rake the reins to Blanche and Fisheye ready in my hand I asked as casually as Icould HowsLeona The Alec of theFourth of July would have cracked fine as frog hair ordandy as a field of dandelions or some such This Alec just said Shes okayo Thengoodbyed me with See you around Jicker Ray Does it ever seem like you can just look at a person and know something thats going to happen to them No o Why I dont mean look at them and knoweverythingo Just somethingo Some one thingo Like what Well like I gazed across the lawn at the Heaney house high and pale white in the dark Ed and Genevieve and Mary Ellen had goneto bed but Ray and I won permission to sprawl on the grass under the giant cottonwood until Rays bedroom cooled down a bit from the sultry dayo The thunderstorm had missed Gros Ventre only left it its wake of heat and charged airo Promise not to laugh at this You couldnt pay me too All right Like when I was talking to Alec out there at the Double Wafter suppero I dont know I just felt like I could tello By the look of himo Tell about what That he and Leona arent going to get marriedo Rayweighed this You said youcould tell something thats going to happeno Thatssomething thats not going to happen Sarne thing Going to happen and not going to happen are the same thing Jick sometimes Never rnildo I stretched an arm in back of my head to rub a knuckle against the cottonwoodo So wrinkled and gullied was its trunk that it looked as if rivulets of rain had been running down it ever since thedelugefloated Noah I drifted in thought past the days stormalong Noon Creek past the Double Wand Alec past the hayfields of the Ramsay place past to where I had it tucked away to tell Ray Saw Marcella a while backo From a distance Yeah Ray responded with what I believe is called elaborate 425 indifferenGea The next morning I returned with the rake to the Reese place confirmed with that the hay was too wet for us to try retrieved Pony and by noon was home at English Creek in time for Sunday During which I related to my parents my visit to the DoubleWa My father the fire season always on his mind now grimaced and said Lightningo Youd think the world could operate without the damn stuU Then he asked Did you see your brother When I said I had he only Givenhowmuch my mother had been on her high horse against the Double Wall sUIIlliler I was set to tell her of the latest cook and the Tomato Smush and the weakling gravyo But before I could get started she fixed me with a thoughtful look and asked Is there anything new with Alec No came flying out of me from some nest of brotherly allegiance I hadnt been aware of o Lord what a wilderness is the thicket of family a No hes just riding around o Thisis what I meant earlier about the chain of events of those lastweek of hayingo If Clayton Hebner had not grabassed himself into a twisted ankle Iwould not now have been the sole depository of the news of Alecs Double W situationo The second Saturday in August oneexact month since we started haying we sited the stacker in the last meadow along Noon Creeko Beforeclimbing on the powerbuckrake Pete cast a long gaze over the windrows estimatingo Then said what didnt surprise anybody whod everbeen in a haying crewbefore Lets see if we can getit all up in one instead of moving thestacker another damn tinleo If you can get it up here vowed Wisdom well find someplace to putlto So that final haystack began to clinlbo Bud Dolson now that mowing was over was ontop helping Wisdom with the stackingo Perry too was done with his part of haying9 no more windrows to be madeo He tied his team in someshade by the creekand in his creaky way was dabbing around the stack with a pitchfork carrying scraps of hay to the stacker forko Clayton I am happy to report hadmended enough to drive the stacker team again and I had regained my scatter rake Of course it was too much hay for one staGko But on a last one that neverstops a hay crewo I raked and reraked behind Petes swoops with his The stack toweredo The final loads wouldnt come off the stacker forkbythemselves Wisdom and Bud pulled up the hay pitchforkful by pitchforkful to the round sununit of the At last every stem of hay was in that staGko How the hell do we get off this thing called down Bud from the island in the air only halfjokingo Along about January I 11 feed from this stack Pete sent back up to htm Ill bring out a ladder and get you theno In actuality the descent of Wisdom and Bud was provided by 427 Claytonrunning the stacker fork up to them sotheycould grab hold of the fork teeth while they climbed down onto the frame Marie had driven up from the main ranch to see this toppingoff of the summers haying and brought with her cold tea and freshbaked oatmeal A crew about to scatter we stood and looked and sipped and Perry to head back into Gros Ventre and a winter of leather workat the saddle shop Bud tonight onto a bus to Anaconda arrl his smelter job Wisdom proclaimed re was heading straight for the redwood logging country dMn in California and Pete ard Bud had worked on him until they got Wisdom to agree that he would ride the bus with Bud as far as Great alls at leastgetting him and his wages past the Medicine Lodge saloqno Clayton over the English CreekNoon Creek divide to the North Fork and Hebner life again Pete and Marie to fencing the haystacks and then shipping the lambs and then trailing the Reese sheep home fromthe Reservation and all too soon feeding out the hay we had put Me to again become a daytime dweller at English Creek instead of a nightly visitoro And the tall tall last haystack standing over us as if it was a holy mound we had come to to hear where each of us was to go next in life h28 Either this weather is Out Of Control declared my mother or Im Getting Old It can be guessed which of those she thought was the case This summer did not seem to be aware that with haying done it was supposed to be thinking about departure The wickedest weather yet settled in a real siege of swelter The first three days I was home at English Creek after finishing at Petes the temperature hit the 90s and the rest of the next couple of weeks wasnt a whole lot better Too hot Putting up with heat while you drive a scatter rake or work some other job is one thing But having the temperature try to toast you while youre just hanging around and existing that somehow seems a personal insult Nor for all her lament about Augusts runaway warmth was my mother helping the situation any The contrary She was canning And canning and canning It started each June with rhubarb and then would come a spurt of cooking homemade sausage and layering it in crocks with the fat over it and next would be the first of the garden vegetables peas and after them beets to pickle and then the various pickings of beans all the while interspersed with making berry jams and at last in late August the arrival to Helwigs mere in Gros Ventre of the flat boxes of canning peaches and pears We ate all winter on what my mother put up but the price of it was that during a lot of the hottest days of summer the kitchen range also was blazing away So whenever canning was 429 the agenda I steered clear of the house as much as I could It was that or melt In the station as well life sometimes got too warm for comfort although not just because of the temperature reading Hows it look my father asked his dispatcher Chet Barnouw first thing each morning This time of year this sizzling August Chets reports were never good Extreme danger was the fire rating on the Two Medicine National Forest now day after day There already were fires big ones on forests west of the Continental Divide the Bad Rock Canyon fire in the Flathead National Forest was just across the mountains from us Poor Chet His reward for reporting all this was to have my father say Is that the best news you can come up with My father put it lightly or tried to but both Chet and the assistant ranger Paul Eliason knew it was the start of another touchy day Chet and Paul were young and in their first summer on the Two and I know my father suffered inwardly about their lack of local knowledge Except for being wet behind the ears they werent a bad pair But in a fire summer like this that was a big except As dispatcher Chet was in charge of the telephone setup that linked the lookout towers and the fire guard cabins to the ranger station and he kept in touch with headquarters in Great Ealls by the regular phone system His main site of operation thus was the switchboard behind a partition at one side of my fathers office I think my mother was the one who gave that cubbyhole the name of the belfry 430 from all the phone signals that c himed in there The belfry took some getting used to for anybody but Chet was an unhurryable t ype best fitted for the job of dispatcher Of the two Paul Eliason gave my father more grief than Chet did Paul did a lot of moping Youd have thought he was born looking glum about it Actually the case was that the previous winter just before he was transferred to the English Creek district as my fathers assistant ranger Paul and his wife had gotten a divorce and shed gone home to her mother in Seattle According to what my father heard from Paul it was one of those things She tried for a year to put up with being a Forest Service wife but Paul at the time was bossing CCC crews who were building trail on the Olympic National Forest out in the state of Washington and the living quarters for the Eliasons was a backcountry oneroom cabin which featured packrats and a cookstove as temperamental as it was ancient Perfect circumstances to make an assistant was city wife marriage go flooey if it ever Hes starting to heal up my father assessed Paul at this point of the sununer Lord knows Ive tried to keep him busy enough he doesnt have time to feel sorry for himself If I rationed myself and didnt get in the way of business my father didnt mind that I hung around in the ranger station But there was a limit on how much I wanted to do that too Whenever something was happeningthe lookouts up there along the skyline of 431 the Two calling in their reports to Chet in the belfry my father tracing his finger over and over the map showing the pocket fires his srnokecashers and fire guards already had dealt withthe station was a lively enough place to be But in between those times rangering was not much of a spectator sport Each day is a room of time it is said In that long hot remainder of August I knew nothinq to do but go from one span of sun to the next with as little of rubbing against my parents as possible My summers work was done they were at the zenith of theirs Consequently a good deal of my leisure or at least timekilling was spent along the creek I called it fishing although it didnt really amount to that Fish are not dumb they dont exert selves to swallow a hook during the hot part of the day a the trout showed any signs of biting I would shade up wood pull an old magazine from my hip pocket and read A couple of times each week I would saddle Pony and ride up to Breed Butte to check on Walter Kyles place then fish the North Fork beaver dams on my way home Walters place was a brief hermitage for me on those visits The way it worked was this We and Walter were in the habit of swapping magazines and after I had chosen several to take from the pile on his shelf I would sit at his kitchen table for a while before heading down to the beaver dams The low old ranch house of Walter Kyles was as private a place 432 as could be asked for To sit there at the table looking out the window to the south down the slope of Breed Butte to the willow thickets of the North Fork and beyond to Grizzly Reefs crooked cliffs and the line of peaks into the Teton River country was to see the earth empty of people Just out of sight down the North Fork was our ranger station and only over the brow of Breed Butte the other direction was the old McCaskill homestead now Hebnerized But all else of this long North Fork coulee was vacancy Not wilderness of course Scotch Heaven left traces of itself a few homestead houses still standing or at least not quite fallen down fencelines whose prime use now was for hawks to perch on But any other breathing soul than me no The sense of emptiness all around made me ponder the isolation those early people my fathers parents among them landed themselves into here Even when the car arrived into this corner of the Two Medicine country mud and rutted roads made going anywhere no easy task To say nothing of what winter could do Some years the snow here drifted up and up until it covered the fenceposts and left you guessing its depth beyond that It went without saying that those homesteaders of Scotch Heaven did not know what they were getting into But once in how many cherished this land as their own ever its conditions It is one of those matters hard to balance out Distance and isolation create a freedom of sorts The space to move in according to your own whims and bents Yet it was exactly this freedom this fact that a person was a speck on the 433 earth sea that must have been too much for some of the settlers From my fathers stories and Toussaint Rennies I knew of Scotch Heaveners who retreated into the dimness of their homestead cabins and the worse darkness of their own minds Others who simply got out walked away from the years of homestead effort Still others who carried it with them into successful ranching Then there were the least lucky who took their dilemma a freedom of space and a toll of mind and muscle to the grave with them It was Alec who had me thinking along these heavy lines Alec and his insistence on an independent life Was it worth the toll he was paying I could not give an absolute affidavit either way What I did know for sure was that Alecs situation now had me in my own kind of bind For if my parents could learn what a fizzle Alecs Double W job was it might give them fresh determination to persuade him out of it At very least it might soften the frozen mood put them and him on speaking terms again But I had told Alec Id say nothing to them about his situation And his asking of that was the one true brothertobrother moment between us since he left English Creek Thats next thing to hopless to spend your time wishing you werent in the fix you are And so I fished like an apostle and read and read and hung around the ranger station betweentimes and eventually even came up with something else I wanted to do with myself The magazines must have seeded the notion in me In any 434 case it was during those hot drifting last of August days that I proposed to my mother that I paper my bedroom She still was canning Pole beans by now I think She tucked a wisp of hair back from where it had stuck to her damp forehead and informed me Wallpaper costs money I never did understand why parents seem to think this is such startling news that thing a kid wants costs money Based on my own experience as a youngster the real news would have been if the object of desire was for free But this once I was primed for that response from my mother Ill use magazine pages I suggested Out of those old Posts and Colliers Theres a ton of pictures in them Mom That I had thought the matter through to this extent told her this meant something to me She quit canning and faced me Even so it would mean buying the paste But I suppose I still had my ducks in a row No it wont The Heaneys have got some left over I heard Genevieve say Rays mother had climaxed her spring cleaning that year by redoing the Heany front hall All right my mother surrendered Its too hot to argue The next time anybody makes a trip to town well pick up your paste I can be fastidious when its worth being so The magazine accumulation began to get a real goingover from me for illustrations worthy of gracing my sleep parlor 435 Id much like to have had western scenes but do you know I could not find any that were worth a damn A story called Bitter Creek showed a guy riding with a rifle across the pommel of his saddle and some packhorses behind him The packhorses were all over the scenery instead of strung together by rope and there was every chance that the guy would blast his leg off by not carrying that rifle in a scabbard So much for Bitter Creek Then there was a story which showed a couple on horseback which drew me because the pair made me think of Alec and Leona It turned out though that the setting was a dude ranch and the line under the illustration read One Dude Ranch is a Good Deal Like Another You Ride Horseback and You Overeat and You Lie in the Sun and You Fish and You Play Poker and You Have Picnics All of which may be true enough but I didnt think it interesting enough to deserve wall space No the first piece of art I really liked was a color illustration in Colliers of a tramp freighter at anchor And then I found a Post on piece showing a guy leaning the railing of another merchant vessel and looking across the water to a beautiful sailing ship As the Inchcliffe Castle Crawled Along the Coast of Spain Through the Strait of Gibraltar the Engineer Was Prey to a Profound Preoccupation This was more like it A nautical decor just what the room could use I went ahead and snipped out whatever sea story illustrations I could find in the stack of magazines I could see that there wasnt going to be enough of a fleet to cover the whole wall but across a Mr Moto detective series that went on 436 practically forever and so I filled in along the top of the wall with action scenes from that as a kind of contrasting bordero When I was well launched into my paperhanging Mr Moto and various villans up top there and the sea theme beginning to fill in under I called in my mother to see my progresso It does change the look of the place she granted The evening of the 25th of August a Friday an electrical storm struck across western Montana and then moved to our side of the Continental Divide It threw firebolts beyond number At Great Falls radio station KFBB was knocked off the air and power lines blew out I would like to be able to say that I awoke in the big storm so keen a weather wizard that I sat up in bed sniffing the ozone or harking to the first distant avalanche of thunder The fact is I snoozed throughthatelectrical night like Sleeping Beauty The next morning more than 200 new lightning fires were reported in the national forests of Region One Six were my fathers One near the head of the South Fork of English Creek One at the base of Billygoat Peak Two in the old Phantom Woman burn probably snags alight One in northwest behind Jericho Reef And one up the North Fork at Flume Gulch The McCaskill household was in gear by daybreak 437 Fire school never told us they come half a dozen at a time muttered my father and went out to establish himself in the ranger station I stoked away the rest of my breakfast and got up to follow him My mother halfadvised and halfinstructed Dont wear out your welcome But she knew as well as anything that it would take logchains and padlocks to keep me out of the station with all this going on As soon as I stepped in I saw that Chet and Paul looked braced As if they were sinners and this was the morning after when they had to stand accountable to a tall redhaired Scotch preacher My father on the other hand was less snorty than hed been in weeks Waiting for the bad to happen was always harder for him than trying to deal with it once it did All right was all my father said to the pair of them lets get the guys to chasing these smokes Chet started his switchboard work and the log of who was sent where at what time Paul began assessing where he ought to pitch inrperson The day was not August5s hottest but hot enough It was vital that all six plumes of smoke be gotten to as quickly as possible before midday heat encouraged these smudges to become genuine fires The job of smokechaser always seemed to me a hellish one shuffling along a mountainside with a big pack on your back and then when you finally sighted or sniffed out the pocket of fire using a shovel or a pulaski to smother it to death All the while dry trees 438 standing around waiting to catch any embers and go off like Roman candles No where fire fighting of any sort was concerned I considered myself strictly a distant witness Alec had done some a couple of Augusts ago on the firelire against the Biscuit Creek blaze dCMn on Murray Tomlins ranger district at the south end of the Two am as with everythiqs else he showed a knack for it But I did not take after my brother in that regard It was mostly good news I was able to repeat to my mother when I visited the house for gingersnaps just past midmorning Chet had reported to headquarters in Great Falls Weve got 10 am control on four of oursthe South Fork Billygoat and the two Phantom Woman situations All four were snag strikes lightning gashing into a dead tree trunk and leaving it slowly burning and the rearest fire guard had been able put out the South Fork smolder the lookout man arrl the snokechaser statiored on Billygoat Peak combined to whip theirs while the Phantom Woman pair of smokes were clooe enough together that the smokecmser whod been dispatched up there managed to mndle both So those four nGT were history Jericho Reef and Flume Gulch were actual blazes small ones but still alive and trying A fire guard named Andy Ames and a smokechaser named Emil Kratka were on the Flume Gulch blaze Both were new to that area of the Iwo but my father thought well of them Theyll stomp it if anybody can Jericho Reef so much farther back in the mountains seemed more like trouble Nobody wanted a backcountry fire getting underway in weather like this Paul had nibbled on 439 the inside of his lips for a while then suggested that he collect the CCC crew that was repairing trail on the North Fork and go on up to the Jericho Reef situation My father told him that sounded right and charged off up there Fire season in the Forest Service said my mother There is nothing like it except maybe St Vitus dance Ours was the only comparatively good news in the Two Medicine National Forest that Saturday On his Indian Head district south of us Cliff Bowen had a fire away to hell and gone up in the mountains under the Chinese Wall A bunch of EFFsemergency fire fighters those were casual labor who were signed on in a real pinchwere being sent from Great Falls but it would take Cliff most of the day just to hike them up to his fire Gives me a nosebleed to think about fighting one up there my father commiserated And at tail Gulch down by Sun River Murray Tomlin was still scooting his smokechasers here and there to tackle a dozen snag strikes The worst of the electrical storm must have dragged through Murrays district on its way to Great Falls Sunday the day of rest was the mutter from my father as he headed to the ranger station the next morning Had he known he would have uttered something stronger It turned out to be a snake of a day By the middle of the morning Chet was telling Great Falls about 10 am control on one of our two blazesbut not the one he and my father expected Jericho Reef was whipped Paul and his CCs found only a quarteracre ground fire there and promptly managed to mop it up Paul should have taken marshmallows my father was moved to joke to Chet Flume Gulch though had grown into something fledged All day Saturday Kratka and Ames had worked themselves blue against the patch of flame and by nightfall they thought they had it contaimd But during the night a remnant of flame crawled along an area of rock coated with pine needles Suniay morning it surfaced touched off a tree opposite from wEre Kratka am Ames were keeping an eje on rra tters and the fire tren took off daJn a slant of the gulch into a thick stand of lodgepole In a hurry my father yanked Paul and his CCs back from Jericho Reef to Flume Gulch and I was killing time in the ranger station late that morning when Chet passed along the report Paul was phoning in from the guard cabin nearest Flume Gulch Thus I was on hand for those words of Pauls that became fabled in our family Mac Chet recited them Paul says the fire doesnt look that bad It just keeps burning is all Is that a fact said my father carefully too carefully Then it all came Kindly tell Mr goddamn Eliason from me that its his goddamn job to see to it that the goddamn fire DOESNT keep burning and that Ino never mind My father got back his breath and most of his temper Just tell Paul to keep at it keep trying to pinch it off against a rock formation Keep it corraled hhl MondCV rmde Sunday look good Paul and his CC crew still could not firrl the handle on the Flurre Gulch fire Trey would get a firelire built around moot of it toon a burning lodgepole pire would crash over arrl corre sledding darn the gulch igniting the next stard of tirrlerdry tinber Or sparks would shoot up from one slope firo enough air e current to waft to the other side of the gulch arrl set off a spot fire Ten am came and went with Pauls report substantially the sane as his ones from the day before not that much fire but no sight of control My father prowled the ranger station until he about had the floor worn out When he said something unpolite to Chet for the third time and started casting around for a fresh target I cleared out of there The day was another scorcher I went to the spring house for some cold milk then in to the kitchen for a doughnut to accompany the milk down And here my father was again being poured a cup of coffee by my mother As if he needed any more prowl fuel today My father mimicked Pauls voice Mac the fire doesnt look that bad It just keeps burning is all Jesus How am I supposed to get through a fire season with help like that I ask you The same way you do every summer suggested my mother I dont have a pair of green peas as assistant and dispatcher every summer No only about every other summer As soon as you get them trained Sipe or the Major moves them on and hands you the next fresh ones Yeah well At least these two arent as green as they were 442 a month ago For whatever thatis worth He waa drinking that coffee as if it was going to get away from him It seemed to be priming him to think out loud I dont like it that the fire outjumped Kratka and Ames Theyre a real pair of smokehounds those guys It takes something nasty to be too much for them And I dont like it that Pauls CCs havent got matters in hand up there yet either My father looked at my mother as if she had the answer to what he was saying I dont like any of what Im hearing from Flume Gulch I gathered that she said Do you want me to put you up a lunch I havent said yet Im going up there Youre giving a good imitation of it Arn I He carried his empty coffee cup to the sink and put it in the dishpan Well Lisabeth McCaskill you are famous the world over for your lunches Id be crazy to pass one up wouldnt I II All right then But before starting to make his sandwiches my mother turned to him one more time Mac are you sure Paul cant handle this Which meant are you sure you shouldnt let Paul handle this fire Bet theres nothing Id like more But I dont get the feeling its being handled Pauls been lucky on his other fires this summer they both turned out to be weinie roasts up He prowled over to the window where one isnt hh3 Peak could be seen No Id better get up there and have a look I didnt even bother to ask to go along A counting trip or something else routine that was one thing But the Forest Service didnt want anybody out of the ordinary around a fire Particularly if their sum of life hadnt yet quite made it to 15 years Mom I was wondering Supper was in the two of us she had washed the dishes and I had dried I could just as well have abandoned the heat of the house for an evening of fishing But I had to rid myself of at least part of what had been on my mind the past weeks I was wonderingwell about Leona Here was an attentiongetter My mother lofted a look and held it on me And what is it youve been wondering about Leona Her and Alec I mean All right What about them I decided to go for broke I dont think theyre going to get married What do you think I think I have a son in this kitchen whos hard to keep up with Why are Alec and Leona tonights topic Its not just tonights I defended This whole sununer has been different Ever since the pair of them walked out of here that suppertime I cant argue with you on that But where do you get the idea the marriage is off I thought about how to put it You remember that story Dode tells about Dad About the very first time you and Dad started uh going together Dad was riding over to call on you and Dode met up with him on the road and saw Dads clean shirt and shined boots and the big grin on him and instead of Hello Dode just asked him Who is she Yes she said firmly I know that story Well Alec doesnt look that way He did earlier in the summer But when I saw him at the Double W that time he looked like somebody had knocked the blossom off him Like Leona had My mother was unduly slow in responding I had been so busy deciding how much I could say without going against my promise to Alec not to tell what a botch his Double W job was that I hadnt realized she too was doing some deciding Eventually her thoughts came aloud You may have it right About Leona Were waiting to see She saw that I damn well wanted a definition of we Leonas parents and I I saw Thelma Tracy the last time I was in town She said Leonas mind still isnt made up which way to choose Choose I took umbrage on Alecs behalf What has she been seeing some other guy too No To choose between marrying Alec and going on with her last year of high school is what shes deciding Thelma thinks school is gaining fast She reminded me as if I needed any It starts in a little over a week 446 to Flume Gulch Rubber that will you Jick called my mother from whatever chore she was on elsewhere in the house Please I went to wall phone and put the receiver to my ear Rubbering which is to say listening in was our way of keeping track of matters without perpetually traipsing back and forth between the house and the ranger station Mac says to tell Great Falls theres no chance of controlling the fire by 10 today Paul was reporting to Chet If you want his exact words he says there isnt a diddling deacons prayer of whipping it today Even on the phone Pauls voice sounded pouty My bet was when my father arrived and took over as fire boss Paul had reacted like a kicked pup Approximate words will do given the mood Macs been in Chet told Paul Anything else new up there No from Paul and his click of hanging up I relayed this in edited form to my mother She didnt say anything but with her silence often conveyed enough When the same phone ring happened in late morning I called out Ill rubber This voice was my father himself ornery It is he was informing Chet Every time a person looks at it it looks a little bigger We better hit it hard Get hold of Isidor and have him bring in a camp setup 1 think I have said And tell Great Falls we need fifty EFFs EFFs were emergency fire 447 fighters guys scraped together and signed up from the bars and flophouses of Galena Street in Butte and Trent Avenue in Spokane and First Avenue South in Great Falls Say again qn that EFF request Mac queried Chet Fifteen or fifty Onefive or fiveoh Fiveoh Chet Pause Chet was swallowing on the figure With crews of EFFs already on the Chinese Wall fire and the fires down in the Lewis and Clark forest Two headquarters in Great Falls was going to greet this like the miser meeting the tax man Okay Mac Chet mustered Ill ask for them What else can I get you Chet could not have realized it but this was his duction to the Golden Rule of a veteran ranger such as my father when confronted with a chancy fire always ask for more help than you think youll need Or as my father said hed once heard it from a ranger of the generation before him While youre getting get plenty Grub my father was going on Get double lunches in here for us today Double luncoos were pretty much what they sourrl like about twice the quantity of sandwicoos and canned fruit arrl so on that a mn could ordinarily consume Fire fighters needed legerrlary amounts of food And get a real cook for too camp by mnight The CC guy we been reing could burn water I 1m going to get some use out of him by puttiq him on the fireline Okay said Chet again The double lunches Ill get out of Gros Ventre and Ill start working on Great Falls for the fifty men and a cook Anything else Not for now allowed my father Then Jick You there I jumped but managed Yeah I figured you were Hows your fishing career Owe me a milkshake yet No I didnt go last night All right I was just checking A moment then Is your mother around there Shes out in the root cellar putting away canning Is she Okay then Anything you want me to tell her Uh huh for all the good itll do Tell her not to worry I will if I want to she responded to that Any time your father asks Great Falls for help its worth worrying about She set off toward the ranger station At least I can go into town for the double lunches Thatll keep Chet free here You can ride in with me While she was gone to apprise Chet the Flume Creek fire and my father filled my mind Trying to imagine what the scene must be That campsite where my father and I and Alec in the other summers caught our fill of brookies and then lazed around the campfire flames now multiplied by maybe a million Intheback of all our minds my fathers and my mothers and mine we had known that unless the weather let up it would be a miracle not to have a fire somewhere on the Two Montana weather and a miracle Neither one is anything to rest your hopes on But why out of all the English Creek district 449 of the Two Medicine National Fcrest did the fire have to be there in that extreme and beautiful country of Flume Gulch I heard the pickup door open and my mother call Jick Let s goo I opened the screen door and stepped from the kitchen Then called back No I think Ill just stay here From behind the steering wheel she sent me a look of surprise Do you feel all right That I would turn down a trip to town must be a malady of some sort she figured Yeah But I just want to stay and do some more papering on my room She hesitated Dinnertime was not far off her cookly conscience now was siding with her motherly one I thought wed grab a bite at the Lunchery If you stay youll have to fix your own Yeah well I can manage to do that As I was counting on she didn t have time to debate with me All right then Ill be back as soon as I can And the pickup was gone I made myself a headcheese sandwich then had a couple of cinnamon rolls and cold milk All the while my mind on what I had decided my eyes on the clock atop the sideboard Each day a room of time Now each minute as slow as the finding and pasting of another page onto my bedroom wall in there I waited out the clock because I had to It at last came up on the noon hour The time to do it h50 Out the kitchen door I went sprinting to the ranger station Just before coming around to its front I geared myself down to what I hoped was my usual walking pace Chet was tigped back in a chair in the shade of the porch while he ate his lunch as Id counted on Dispatchers are somewhat like gophers theyre holed up indoors so much they pop out into the air at any least chance as Hey there Jick I was greeted by Chet I sauntered onto the porch Whats up Its too blasted hot to move if you dont have to I came to see if its okay if I use the town line I forgot to tell Mom something and I want to leave word for her at the Lunchery Sure thing Nothings going on right now you can help yourself You shouldve just rung me Jick Id have gone in and switched it for you Uhhuh and more than likely have stayed on and listened as was a dispatchers habit Rubbering was something that worked both directions No thats okay I didnt want to bother you I wont need the line long In I went to the switchboard and moved the toggle switch that connected the ranger station to the community line When youre done Chet said as I headed off the porch past him just ding the dealybob and Ill switch things back to our line Right Thanks Chet Like I say I wont be long I moseyed around the corner of the station out of Chets sight then 451 sped like hell back to our house Facing the phone I sucked in all the breath I could to crowd out my puffing and my nervousness about all that was riding on this idea of mine Then I lifted the receiver rang central in Gros Ventre and asked to be put through to the Double W Onto the line came a womans voice Hello Perfect again Meredice Williamson I hadnt been sure what I was going to resort to if Wendell answered Lo Mrs Williamson Can Imay I speak to Alec McCaskill in the bunkhouse please That is would you ask him to go to the phone out at the bunkhouse This is uh personal Down the line came the silence of Meredice Williamson pondering her way through the etiquette of yet another Two country situation Maybe I would have been better off with Wendells straight forward bluster At last she queried Who is this please This is Alecs brother Jick I put Blanche and Fisheye in your barn that time remember And Im sorry to call but I just really need to talk to Oh yes Jack I remember you well But you see Alec and the other men are at lunch Yeah I figured that thats why Im calling right now could I have him return your call afterward11 No thatd be too late I need to talk to him now its just that its like I said private Family A family situation has come up Arisen h52 I see I do hope its nothing serious It could get that way if I dont talk to Alec Mrs Williamson look I cant explain all this But Ive got to talk to Alec while hes alone Without the whole damnwithout everybody listening in I see Yes I think I see Will you hold on Jack As if from a great distance I heard her say Alec youre wanted on the phone I wonder if it might be more convenient for you to answer it in the bunkhouse Now a dead stretch of time But my mind was going like a million All of the summer to this minute was crowded into me From that suppertime when Alec stomped out with Leona in tow through all the days of my brother going his stubborn way and my parents going their stubborn one through my times of wondering how this had come to be how we to McCaskills had so tangled our family si when I saw just how to unknot it all At last it was corning up right the answer was about to dance within this telephone lineFinally a voice from across the miles Jick Is that you What in the holy hell Alec listen I know this is kind of out of the ordinary Youre right about that But just let me tell you all this okay Theres a fire Dads gone up to it at Flume Gulch The hell None of that countrys ever burned before Well it is now And thats why I got hold of you see Alec Dads only help up there is Paul Eliason and Paul doesnt know zero h53 about that part of the Two A void at the Double W bunkhouse The receiver offered only the sounds within my own ear the way a seashell does At last Alecs voice stronger than before demanding Jick did Dad ask you to call me If so why in a11 hell couldnt he do it him No he didnt ask me Hes up on the fire I just told you Then whois this Moms idea Alec its nobodys damn idea I mean its none of theirs you can call it mine if its anybodys All thats involved Dad needs somebody up there who knows that Flume Gulch country Somebody to help him line out the fire crew That s all huh And you figure it ought to be me I wanted to shout why the hell else would I be on this telephone line with you But instead carefully stayed to Yeah I do Dad needs your help And kept unsaid too this family needs its logjam of quarrel broken Needs you and our father on speaking terms again Needs this summer of separation to be over More of the seashell sound the void Then Jick no I cant Cant Why not Even goddamn Wendell Williamsond let you off to fight a forest fire Im not going to ask him You mean you wont ask him It comes to the same Jick I just 11But why Why wont you do this 454 Because I cant just drop my life and come trotting home Dads got the whole damn Forest Service for help Butthen you wont do it for him Jick listen No I cant or wont however you want to say it But it s not because of Dad its not to get back at him or thing Itisit s all complicated But I got to go on with what Im doing I cant All these years later I realize that here he very nearly said I cant give in But the way Alec actually finished that sentence was I cant go galloping home any time theres a speck of trouble If somebody was sick or hurt itid be different But Then dont do it for Dad I broke in on him and I may have built up to a shout for this Do it because the goddamn countrys burning up Jick the fire is Dads job it s the Forest Services job its the job of the whole crew theyll bring in there to Flume Gulch It is not mine But Alec you cant just Here I ran out of argument The dead space on the telephone line was from my direction now Jick Alecs voice finally came I guess were not getting anywhere with this I guess were not Things will turn out said my brother See you Jick And 455 the phone connection ended It was too much fer me I stood there gulping back tears The house was empty yet they were everywhere around me The feel of them I mean the accumulation the remembering of how life had been when the other three of my family three instead of two against one Or one against two as it looked now Alec My mother My father People A pain you cant do without Eventually I remembered to ding the phone signaling Chet that I was done with the town line Done in was more like it For the sake of something anything to do I wandered to my bedroom and listlessly thumbed through magazines for any more sea scenes to put on the wall Prey to a Profound Preoccupation that was me I heard the pickup arrive Nothing else I did seemed to be any use in the world maybe I at least had better see if my mother needed any help with the fire lunches she was bringing I stepped out the kitchen door to find that help already was on hand beside her at the tailgate of the pickup A brown Stetson nodded to me and under it Stanley Meixell said Hullo again Jick Civility was nowhere among all that crowded my brain just then I simply blurted Are you going up to the fire 456 Thought I would yeah A mans got to do something toward off frostbite My mother was giving Stanley her look that could peel a rock But in an appraising way I suppose she was having second thoughts about what she had set in motion here by fetching Stanley from the Busbys ranch and then third thoughts that any possible help for my father was better than no help then fourth thoughts about Stanleys capacity to be any help and on and on Do you want some coffee she suggested to Stanley I better not take time Bet I can get by without it The fact was it would take more than coffee to make a difference on him Whos this dispatcher we got to deal with My mother told him about Chet Stanley nodded and she and he headed for the ranger station Me right behind them Getting those lunches up thered be a real help all right Chet agreed when my mother presented Stanley But all the while he had been giving Stanley a goingover with his eyes and it must be said Stanley did look the worse for wear looked as old and bungedup and afflicted as the night in the cabin when I was rewrapping his massacred hand In this instance though the affliction was not Stanleys hand but what he had been pouring into himself with it Not somebody you would put on a fire crew at least if your name was Chet Barnouw and the responsibility was directly traceable to you So Chet now went on But beyond you taking those up for us I dont see how we can use h57 Howre you fixed for a hash slinger Stanley asked conversationally Chets eyebrows climbed Ycu mean it You can cook Hes Anumberone at it I chirped in commemoration of Stanleys breakfast the of my hangover Better to my mother If ever there was a grand high authority on food it was her She informed Chet When Stanley says he can do a thing he can All right then said Chet Great Falls more than likely would just dig out some wino fryhouse guy for me anyway The disI patcher caught himself and his throat Well lets get you signed up here Stanley stepped over to the desk with him and did so Chet looked down at the signature with interest Stanley Kelley huh You spell it the same way the Major does My mouth flapped open The look I received from my mother snapped it shut again All politeness Stanley inquired The who Majer Evan Kelley the Regional Forester The big sugar over in Missoula Kind of unusual two es in Kelley You any relation None that I know of Chet went back in his belfry and Stanley headed to the barn to rig up a saddle horse and Brownie as a pack horse Ordinarily 458 I would have gone along to help him But I was shadowing my mother all the way back to the house As soon as we were in the kitchen I said it Morn Ivegot to go with Stanley The same surprise as when Id stepped up and asked to dance the Dude and Belle with her that distant night of the Fourth But this request of mine was a caper in a more serious direction I thought youd had enough of Stanley she reminded me on that camptending episode I did But that was then I tried for the second time this day to put into words more than I ever had before If Stanleys going to be any help to Dad Im going to have to be the help to Stanley You heard him after the carnptending He said he couldnt have got along up there without me There at the fire camp Pauls going to be looking down his neck all the time The first time he catches Stanley with a bottle hell send him down the road Plead is not a word I am ashamed of in the circumstances Let me go with him Morn She shook her head A fire camp is a crazyhouse Jick It wouldnt be just you and Stanley this time They wont let you hang around Here was my ace I can be Stanleys flunky Help him with the cooking That way Id be right there with him all the time Serious as all this was my mother couldnt stop her quick sideways grin at the notion of me around food fulltime But then she 459 sobered With everything in me I yearned that she would see things my way That she would not automatically tell me I was too young that she would let me play a part at last even just as chaperone in this summers stream of events Rare for Beth McCaskill not to have an answer ready by now By now she must have been on tenth and eleventh thoughts about the wisdom of having asked Stanley Meixell to go to Flume Gulch My mother faced me and decided All right Go But stay with Stanley or your father at all times Do you Understand That At All Times Yes I answered her Any term of life as clear as that even I could understand Stanley was my next obstacle She said you can CAN can Yeah she did You can go on in and ask her I kept on with my saddling of Pony No Ill take your word He rubbed the back of his right hand with his left still studying me Going to a fire thoughyou sure you know what youre getting into Canada Dan and Bubbles and Dr Al K Hall in a tin cup had come into my life at the elbow of this man and he could stand there and ask me that 460 I shot back Does anybody ever The squinch around Stanleys eyes let up a little There you got a point Okeydoke Jick Lets get to getting Up the North Fork road the summers second MeixellMcCaskill expedition set out Stanley on a buckskin Forest Service gelding the packhorse Honer with the load named Buck ooth t fi of lunches and me behind on Pony I still dont know how Stanley managed the maneuver but by the time we were past the Hebner place and topping the English CreekNoon Creek divide the smoke rising out of the canyon of the North Fork ahead of us I was riding in the lead just as on our camptending expedition That the reason was the same I had no doubt I didnt bother to look back and try to catch Stanley bugling a bottle as that was a sight I did not want to have to think about No I concentrated on keeping us moving at a fast walk at least as fast as I could urge Ponys short legs to go Something was different though This time Stanley wasnt singing To my surprise I missed it quite a lot Smoke in a straight column Then an oblong haze of it drifting south along the top of Roman Reef The days lone cloud like a roll of sooty canvas on a high shelf 461 A quantity of smoke is an unsettling commodity The human being does not like to think its environs are flammable My mother had the memory that when she was a girl at Noon Creek the smoke from the 1910 fires bought a Bibletoting neighbor a homesteader to the Reese doorstep to announce This is the wrath of God The end of the world is come Daylight dimming out to a sickly green color and no distinct difference between night and day I suppose it would make you wonder That same 1910 smoke never really left my father He must have been about twelve or thirteen then and his memory of that summer when the millions of acres burned in the Bitterroot while the had its own long stubborn fire was the behavior of the chickens there at the family homestead on the North Fork Christamighty Jick by about noon theyd go in to roost for the night it got so dark The 1910 smoke darkness and then the scarred mountainside of Phantom Woman as a reminder they stayed and stayed in my father smears of dread Stanley too had undergone the 1910 smoke In the cabin he had told me of being on that fire crew on the Two fire west of Swift Dam Such as we were for a crew Everybody and his cousin was already fighting some other sonuvabitch of a fire Bitterroot or somewheres else We dabbed at it here as best we could a couple of weeks Yeah and we managed to lose our fire camp The wind come up and turned a flank of that fire around and brought it right into our camp A thing I never will forget Jick all the canned goods blew up That 462 was about all that was left when the fire got done with that camp a bunch of exploded goddamn tin cans All three of them each with a piece of memory of that awful fire summer Of how smoke could multiply itself until it seemed to claim the world Now that my father had stepped in as fire boss at Flume Gulch Paul Eliason was the camp boss I will say Paul was marshaling things into good order We rode in past a couple of CCs a toilet trench A couple of otrers were setting up the coumil tent each of them powrling in 4ille tent pegs with the flat of an axe The feed grourdthe kitchen areaalready was built and there we encountered Paul Paul still had an expression as if somebody big was standing on his foot and he was trying to tigure out what to say about it but Honer he lost no time in sending one of the ccs off and the lunches to the fire crew Late is better than never he rattled off as if he invented that Thanks for delivering Jick he next next recited awarded Stanley a nod too and started back to of inspection Paul I managed to slow and turn him somebody here you got to meet This is Stanley uh Kelley Pleased to know you ranger and ard hes here to I finally found the inspiration I needed Chet signed him on as your cook Well as far as it went that was true wasnt it 463 Paul studied this news I thought Chet told me he was going to have to get one out of Great Falls and the chances didnt look real 9ood even there He must have had his mind changed I speculated Must have Pail conceded He looked Stanley over Have you ever cooked for a fire camp before No responded Stanley But I been in a fire camp before and I cooked before So it adds up to the same crike 1 s sake mister Have you got any idea what it takes to cook for a bunch of fire fighters They eat like Oh yeah Stanley inserted and I almost forgot to tell you I alsove ate fire camp grub So I been through the whole job a little at a time Uh huh emitted from Paul more as a sigh than an acknowledgment Stanley swung his gaze around the camp in interest Have you 9ot some other candidate in mind for cook tre devil I guess youre it So the feed ground is yours mister Paul waved to the area where the cookstove and a work table ano the big T table to serve f rorn had been set up You better get at it Youre going to have CCs corning at you from down that mountain and EFFs coming up from Great Falls Figure supper fer about 75 Paul turned to me Jick I appreciate you getting those lunches up here If you start back now youll be home well before dark 464 Well actually Im staying I informed Paul I can be Stanleys flunky My mom said its okay Possibly this was the first time a member of a fire crew ever arrived with an excuse from his mother and it sure as hell was nothing Paul Eliason had ever dealt with before Particularly from a mother such as mine You could all but see the thought squatting there on his mind what next from these damn McCaskills But Paul only said You sort that out with your father And sailed off to finish worrying the camp into being Stanley and I began to tour our feed ground An open fire pit and not far from it the stove Both were lit and waiting as if hinting that they ought to be in use A long work table built of stakes and poles And about twenty feet beyond it the much bigger Tshaped serving table I could see the principle tin plates and utensils and bread and butter and so forth were to be stacked along the stem of the T so the fire crew could file through in a double lineone along each side of the stemto the waiting food at both arms of the T The food though That I could not envision how Stanley and I were going to manage in the next few hours to prepare a meal for 75 guys So Stanley announced I guess This I could have completed in my sleepwe got it to do The Forest Service being the Forest Service and Paul being Paul there hung a FIRE CAMP COOK BOOK on a nail at the serving table Stanley peered over my shoulder as I thumbed to the page titled 465 FIRST SUPPER then ran my finger down that page to where it was decreed Menubeef stew Slumgullion Stanley interpreted At least it aint mutton Below the menu selection instructing began in earnest Place large wash boiler half full of water on fire Christamighty Stanley we better get to I began before noticing the absence at my shoulder Over beside the packs of groceries Stanley was leaning down to his saddlebags Oh Jesus I could forecast the rest of that movement before it happened his arm going in and bringing forth the whiskey bottle I dont know which got control of my voice dismay or anger But the message was coming out clear Goddamn it all to hell Stanley if you start in on that stuff Jick you are going to worry yourself down to the bone if you keep on Here take yourself a swig of this No damn it We got seventyfive men to feed One of us has got to have enough damn brains to stay sober I know how many we got to feed Take a little of this in your mouth just enough to wet your whistle When things start to skid they really do go dont they It wasnt enough that Stanley was about to begin a bender he was insisting on me as company My father would skin us both My mother would skin whatever was left of me after my fathers skinning Just taste it Jick Stanley was holding the bottle out to 466 me patient as paint All right all goddamn right I had run out of thinking space all the foreboding in the world was in me instead I would buy time by faking a little swig of Stanleys joy juice maybe after putting the bottle to my lips like this I could accidentally on purpose drop theWater Yet not quite only water I swigged a second time to be sure of the taste Just enough whiskey to flavor it faintly If Id had to estimate perhaps a fingers worth of whiskey had been left in the bottle before Stanley filled it with water Itll get me by Stanley asserted He looked bleak about the prospect and said as much Its worse than being weaned a second time But I done it before a time or two when I really had to Now we better get down to cooking dont you figure The Forest Service must of decided everything tastes better with tin around it observed Stanley as he dumped into the boiler eight cans each of tomatoes and peas Sounds good to me right now I said from where I was slicing up several dozen carrots You got time to slice some bread Stanley inquired from where he was stirring stew Yeah I was tending a round boiler in which twelve pounds 467 of prunes were being simmered for dessert but figured I could dive back and forth between tasks How much This is the Yew Ess Forest Service remember How ever much it says in the book I went and looked again at the FIRST SUPPER page Twenty loaves Jick see what it says about how much of this sand and snoose to put in the stew Stanley requested from beside the wash boiler a big pox of salt in one hand and a fairly sizable one of pepper in the other It doesnt It which All the cook book says is Season to taste Aw goddamn My right arm and hand felt as if theyd been slicing for years I remembered I was supposed to set out five pounds of butter to go with the bread Stanley now was the one at the cook book swearing a steadily as he tried third time to divine the proportions of salt and pepper for a wash boiler of stew Whats it say to put this butter on His finger explored along the page Pudding dishes You got time to start the coffee after that I guess What do I do 468 toom Fill two boilers in the creek All afternoon Paul had been going through the camp at such a pace that drinks could have been served on his shirttail But he gave Stanley ani me wide berth until te at last had to pop over to tell us the fire crew was on its way in for supper He couldnt oolp eyeing us dubiously I was sweaty and bedraggled Stanley was parcood ani bedraggled Mind if I try your stew Paul proposed I say proposed because even though Paul was camp boss it was notorious that a cook coming up on mealtime had to be handled with kid gloves This advantage must have occurred to Stanley because he gave Paul a flat gaze stated If youre starving to death go aheadI got things to do and royally strode over to the work table where I was We both watched over our shoulders like owls though Paul grabbed a spoon advanced on the stew tub dipped out a dab blew on it tasted Then repeated Then swung around toward us Mister you werent just woofing You can cook Shortly the CCs streamed into camp and Stanley and I were dishing food onto their plates at a furious rate A day on a fire line is ash and sweat so these CCs were not exactly fit for a beauty contest But they were at that brink of manhoodall of them about Alecs agewhere energy recovers in a hurry In fact their appetites recuperated instantly Some CCs were back on line for seconds before wed finished serving everybody a first helping Paul saw how swamped Stanley and I were with the serving and sent two of his CC camp flunkies to take over from us while we 469 fussed with reheating and replenishment The fifty emergency fire fighters from Great Falls were yet to come So was my father I had seen him appear into the far end of camp conferring with Kratka and Ames now his fireline foremen and head with them to the council tent He wore his businesslike look Not a good sign I was lugging a resupply of prunes to the T table when I glanced into the grub line and met the recognition of my father his hand in midreach for a tin plate For a moment he simply tried to register that it was me standing befcre him in a flour sack apron 11Jick What in the name of hell are you doing here Lo Dad Uh Im being the flunky Youre That stopped not only my fathers tongue but all other parts of him He stood rooted And when I sunk in so to speak he of course had to get his mind to decide who to skin alive for this Paul or Chet Morn said I could I put in helpfully This announcement plainly was beyond mortal belief so now my father had definite words to express to me Youre going to stand there with your face hanging out and tell me your mother Then the figure at the stove turned around to him that behind this second flour sack apron was Stanley Hullo Mac Stanley called out I hope you like slumgullion Cause thats what it is 470 Jesus H My father became aware of the audience of CCs piling up behind him in the grub line Im coming around there you two You better have a story ready when I arrive Stanley andI retreated to the far end of the kitchen area while my father marched around the T table to join us He arrived aiming huffy looks first to one of us and then the other back and forth as if trying to choose between targets Now he stated Let s hear it Youre kind of on the prod Mac observed Stanley You dont slumgullion care that much cisahuh Stanley goddamn you and your slurngullion What in the hell are the pair of you doing in this fire camp Stanley was opening his mouth and I knew that out of it was going to drop the reply Cooking To head that off I piped Mom figured you could use our help She figured what She wouldnt have sent usadjusting the history of my inception into the trip with Stanley and the lunchesif she hadnt figured that would she And whats the matter with our cooking Some CCs were back in line for third helpings they didnt seem to lack appreciation of our cuisine I noticed something else My father no longer was dividing huffy looks between Stanley and me He was locked onto Stanley My presence in this fire camp was not getting my fathers main attention 471 As steadily as he could after his afternoon of drought and wholesale cookery Stanley returned the scrutiny Mac he said in that raspedover voice from when my father and I first met him on the trail that day of June youre the fire boss You can put the run on us anytime you want But until you do we can handle this cooking for you My father at last said Im not putting the run on anybody Dish me up some of your goddamn slumgullion It was getting dusk when the EFFs arrived into camp like a raggletaggle army These men were drift straight from the saloons and flophouses of First Avenue South in Great Falls and they more than looked it One guy even had a beard Supposedly a person couldnt be hired for emergency fire fighting unless he owned a stout pair of shoes but of course the same passable shoes showed up on guy after guy in the signup line Most of these EFFs now were shod in weary leather and hardworn blue jeans if they were ranch hands and bib pants if they were gandy dancers or outofwork smeltermen from Black Eagle Motley as they looked from the neck down I paid keener attention to their headgear There was a legend in the Forest Service that a fire boss once told his signup man in Spokane Send me thirty men if theyre wearing Stetsons or fifty if theyre wearing caps Most of these EFFs at least were hattedthey were used to outdoor work were not city guys except for recreational purposes 472 I remember that this time Stanley and I were lugging another boiler of coffee to the T table For I damn near dropped my end when a big guy leaned out of the back of the grub line peered woozily toward me then elled in greeting Hey Jick Wisdom Johnson had not advanced conspiciously far on his plan to head for the redwood country for the winter As soon as Stanley and I got the boiler situated on the table I hustled to the back of the grub line to shake hands with Wisdom That First Avenue South he marveled Thats just quite a place Uh huh I thought And Bouncing Betty is quite a guide to it What my first night in a fire camp was like I cant really tell you For when Stanley and I at last were done washing dishes I entered my sleeping bag and that is the last I know Breakfast though If you have not seen what six dozen fire fighters will consume for breakfast the devastation may shock you It did me after I awoke to the light of a gas lantern and Stanley above it halfcroaking Picnic time again Jick Whack off 150 slices of ham for fryirg Mush two 16quart rourd boilers of water and 4 pourrl s of oatnaal into each Milk for too mush 15 tall cans of Sego mixed with the sane of water Potatoos to make fried spudstrank too Lord we had just enough of the canned variety so that I didn t h73 have to start peeling Fill two more halfbreed boilers for coffee slice another oodle of bread open 7 cans of jam Enough grub to feed China it looked to me like But Stanley viewed matters and shook his head Better dig out a half dozen of those fruitcakes Jick and slice them up I still blink to think about it but only crumbs of those fruitcakes were left when that crew was done That morning my father put his fire fighters to doing everything that the Forest Service said should be done in such a battle Fire lines were being dug snags were being felled wherever possible the flames were pinched against Flume Gulchs rocky outcroppings It truly was a bastardly site to have to tackle The fire had started at the uppermost end of the gulch amid a dry tangle of windfall and was licking its way down through jungly stands of lodgepole pine on the gulchs steep sides Burning back and forth as a falling flaming tree or a shower of sparks would ignite the opposite wall of forest So in a sense in a kind of sloshing pattern the fire was coming right down the trough of natures version of a flume aiming itself into the creekside trees along the North Fork and the high grassy slope opposite the gulch And all the forested country waiting beyond that slope To even get to the fire my fathers men had to climb up the face of the creek gorge into the gulch and once there they had to labor on ground which sometimes tilted sharply ahead of them and sometimes tilted sideways but always tilted At breakfast I had heard one of the CCs telling the EFFs that Flume Gulch was a spraddledyass place1f Besides being high and topsyturvy the fire battlground was hot and dry and my father designated Wisdom Johnson to be the Flume Gulch water cow What this involved was making trips along the f ireline with a 5gallon water pack on his back so that the thirsty men could imbibe a drink from the packs nozzlethe tit I thought I had done every job there was claimed Wisdom but I never hit this one About midmorning when he came down from the gulch to refill Wisdom brought into camp my fathers message for Paul Paul read it shook his head and hustled down the trail to phone it on to Chet at the ranger station Whatd itsay I pumped Wisdom before he could start back up with his sloshing water pack No chance 10 am control today Wisdom quoted Then added his own view of the situation in Flume Gulch Suffering Jesus theyre a thirsty bunch up there A lot of Great Fall nights coming out through the pores Stanley put in piously from the work table where he and I next were going to have make double lunches for the 75 fire fighters Which the cook book enlightened us amounted to 150 ham sandwiches 150 jam sandwiches and 75 cheese sandwiches Slice the meat about four slices to the inch 11 I read in 475 a prissy voice 11 Slice the bread about two slices to the inch Christamighty they want us to do everything by the measurement and then dont provide us any damn thing to measure with Your thumb said Stanley My thumb what Your thumbs a inch wide Close enough to it anyhow Go by that The forest Service has got a regulation for everything up to and including how to swat a mosquito with your hat Sometimes though it dont hurt to swat first and read up on it later My thumb and I set to slicing At noon Paul and his pair of camp flunkies and Stanley and Wisdom and I lugged the sandwiches and canned fruit and pork and beans up to the fireline I had grown up hearing of forest fires The storied fire sununers Bitterroot Phantom Woman Selway this one they amounted to a Forest Service catechism Yet here now was my first close view Except for the smoke boiling in ugly fashion into the sky the scene was not as awful as you might expect Orange flames were a dancing tribe amid the trees and the fire fighters were a rippling line of shovelers and axmen and sawyers as they tried to clear thing flammable from in front of the fire But then when you got over being transfixed by the motions of flame and men the sense of char hit you A smell like charcoal the black smudge of the burned 476 forest behind where the flames were crackling What told me most about the nature of a forest fire however was a single tree a low scrawny jackpine at that It had managed to root high up within a crack in one of the gulchs rock formations and as I was gawking around trying to register everything I saw that tree explode Spontaneously burst into flames there on its stone perch so far from any other foliage or the orange edge of the fire itself I found my father and read his face Serious but not grim He came over to my pack of sandwiches and plowed into one I glanced around to be sure Paul wasnt within hearing then said It doesnt look that bad It just keeps burning is He had to grin at that Thats about the case But I think theres a chance we can kick it in the pants this afternoon Those First Avenuers are starting to get their legs under them Theyll get better at fireline work as the day goes on11 He studied the sky above Roman Reef as if it would answer what he said next What we dont need is any wind To shift himself from that topic my father turned to me How about you How you getting along Okay I never knew people could eat so much though Uh huh Speaking of which pass me another sandwich would you Even my father conscientiously stoking food into himself It was as if the fires hunger for the forest had spread an epidemic of appetite among us as well 477 My father watched Stanley divvy sandwiches out to a nearby bunch of EFFs How about your sidekick there Stanleys doing real good Then the further answer I knew my father was inviting Hes staying dry11 Uh huh Well thats news When he does get his nose in the bottle you let me know Or let Paul know if Im not around We got to have a cook Onell have to be fetched in here from somewhere when Stanley starts a bender 11If he does11 I agreed because of all that was involved Ill say so11 Through the afternoon I flunkied for Stanley Hot in that base camp I hope never to suffer a more stifling day It was all I could do not to wish for a breath of breeze Stanley too was sweating his shirt dark with it This would teach him to joke about other drinkers pores And he looked in semiawful shape Agonized around the eyes the way he had been when Bubbles butchered his hand What bothered me more than his appearance though he was swigging oftener and oftener at the bottle As soon as Stanley went off to visit nature I got over there to his saddle pack yanked the bottle out and sipped It still was water with a whiskey trace Stanleys craving thirst was for the trace rather than the water but so far he hadnt given in 478 This lifted my mood As did the continuing absence of wind I was predicting to Stanley Ill bet they get the fire whipped Maybe so maybe no he responded Where a forest fire is concerned Im betting man How about peeling me a tub of spuds when you get the chance Stanley I guess this isnt exactly any of my business have you seen Velma Since the Fourth Now and then Yeah well Shes quitequite a lady isnt she Quite a one Uh huh Well So how are you two getting along Stanley flexed his hand a time or two then went back to cutting bacon Tonights main course was a casseroleif you can do that by the tubfulof macaroni and canned corn and bacon slices had some times he allowed Weve Times with Velma Simms Plural The gray eyes the pearlbuttoned ears those famous rodeo slacks in multiple Sweat was already rolling off me that morning but this really opened the spigots I went over to the water bucket and splashed a handful on my face and another on the back of my neck Even so I couldnt help resuming the topic Think anything will come of it If you mean permanent nope Velmas gave up marrying and I never got started We both know theres a season on our kind of 479 entertainment Stanley slabbed off another half dozen slices of bacon I peeled away at a spud But a seasons better than no calendar at all is what Ive come to think He squinted at the stacked results of his bacon slicing How many more hogs does that recipe call for I was still peeling when the casualty came down from the gulch He was one of the CCs halfcarried and halfsupported by two others Paul hurried across the camp toward them calling How bad did he get it His cawlehbone and awm one of the helping CCs answered New York Philadelphia Lord only knew what accent any of the CC guys spoke or at least I sure didnt Paul sent the bearers and their casualty on down to the head where his pickup was parked for them to drive in to Gros Ventre and Doc Spence A falling snag had sideswiped the injured CC This was sobering I knew enough fire lore to realize that if the snag had found the ccfu head instead of his collarbone and arm he might have been on his way to the undertaker rather than the doctor As yet PO wind Calm as the inside of an oven and as hot I wiped my brow and resumed peeling What would you think about going for a stroll 480 This proposal from Stanley startled me By now late afternoon he looked as if it took 99 of his effort to stay on his feet let alone put them into motion Huh To wlere His head and Stetson indicated the grassy slope of Rooster Mountain above us opposite the fire Just up there Give us a peek at how things are going I hesitated we did have our supper fixings pretty well in hand But to simply wander off up the mountainsideAw we got time Stanley told me as if hed invented the commodity Our stepdaddyre neant Paul who was down phonillS Chet the report of the injured CCwon t be back for a while Okay then I assented a little nervously As long as were back here in plenty of time to serve supper I swear he said it seriously Jick you know Id never be the one to make you miss a meal I thought it was hot in camp The slope was twice so Facing south as it did the grassy incline had been drinking in sun all day not to mention the heat the forest fire was putting into the air of this whole area Yeah its a warm one Stanley agreed I was watching him with The climb in the heat had tuckered me considerably How Stanley could navigate this mountainside in his bentknee fashionmore than ever he looked like a born horseman grudging the fact of groundwas beyond me s Except for a few scrubby here and there the slope was shadeless until just below its surrunit where the lodgepole forestoverflowed from this mountains north side Really there werent many trees even up there because of the rocky crest the rooster comb And Stanley and I sure as hell werent going that high anyway given the heat and steepness So it was a matter of grit and bear it Stanley did lean down and put a hand flat against the soil of the slope as if he intended to sit I was not surprised when he didnt plop himself down for this sidehills surface was so tropical I could feel its warmth through the soles of my boots Looks to me like theyre holding it11 I evaluated the fire scene opposite us Inasmuch as we were about halfway up our slope we were gazing slightly downward on Flume Gulch and the fire crew Startling how close that scene seemed these two sides of the North Fork vee truly were sharp Across there in the gulch we could see the men strung out along the fireline could even see the strip of turned earth and clearedaway debris like a stripe of garden dirt that they were penning the fire with In a provident moment I had snagged a pair of binoculars from the council tent before Stanley and I set off on our climb With them I could even pick out individuals found my father and Kratka in conference near the center of the fireline Both of them stood in that peering way men do up a sidehill one foot advanced and the opposite arm crooking onto a hip 482 They looked like they could outwait any fire The dry grass creaked and crackled under my feet as I stepped to hand the binoculars to Stanley He had been gandering here there aD elsewhere aroundour slope so I figured he was waiting to use the glasses on the actual fire Naw thats okay Jick I seen enough Kind of looks like a forest fire dont it And he was turning away starting to shuffle back down to the fire camp When the first fire fighters slogged in for supper my father was with them My immediate thought was that the fire was whipped my fathers job as fire boss was done As soon as I could see their faces I knew otherwise The fire fighters looked done in My father looked pained I told Stanley Id be right back and went over to my father It jumped our fireline he told me Three places But how There wasnt any wind Like hell What do you call that whiff about 4 oclock Not down here I maintained We havent had a breath all afternoon Ask Stanley Ask Paul11 My father studied me All right Maybe down here there wasnt any But up there some sure as hell came from somewhere Not much Just enough He told rne the story Around 4 oclock which must have been not long after Stanley and I took our look at things from the slope the east flank of the fire made a run Jumped the fire483 line but we got there and swatted it out While we were doing that it jumped again Got to that one got it out But while we were doing that it jumped one more goddamn time That one flared and a lowerdown stand of lodgepole became orange flame I had to pull the men away from that flank Too damn dangerous So weve got a whole new fire corning right down the mountain Tomorrow were going to have to hold it here at the creek Damn it all to hell anyway My father did fast damage to his plateful of supper and went back up to the fire He was keeping Kratkas crew on watch at what was left of fire line until the cool of the evening would damper the flames Amess gang of CCs and EFFs meanwhile were ready to dine Ready and then some Hey Cookie one among them yelled out to Stanley Whatre you going to founder us on tonight Soupa de boolyon Stanley enlightened him in a chefly accent of some nature Three buckets of water and one onyon Actually the lead course was vegetable soup followed by the baconized macaroni and corn and mashed potatoes with canned milk gravy and rice pudding and all of it tasted just heavenly if I do say so myself Dark was corning on by the time Stanley and I went to the creek to fill a boiler with water as a headstart toward breakfast 485 figure out how were going to handle this fire tomorrow My father and Paul and the pair of crew foremen took lanterns and headed up creek to look over the situation of tomorrow mornings fireline My father of course knew the site backwards and forwards but the hell of it was to try to educate the others in a hurry and in the dark I could not help but think it if AlecAt their bed ground some of the fire crew already were oblivious in their sleeping bags but a surprising many were around campfires sprawled and gabbing The climate of the Two Roast you all day in front of a forest inferno then at dark chill you enough to make you seek out fire While waiting for my father I did some wandering and exercising of my ears I would like to say here and now that these fire fighters elderly from 18yearold CCs to the among the First Avenue South EFFs were earnestly discussing how to handle the Flume Gulch fire I would like to say that but nothing would be farther from the truth Back at the English Creek ranger station on the wall behind my fathers desk was tacked one of those carbon copy gags that circulate among rangers 486 Subjects

catalogue versus Montgomery Ward catalogue 2 The meteorological outlook 2 The j ob at hand 1 From what I could hear that list was just about right 487 Stanley I had not seen for a while and it crossed my mind that he may have had enough of the thirsty life That hed gone off someplace to jug up from an undiluted bottle But no when I at last spied my father and his fire foremen arrl Paul returning to camp and then heading for the tent to continue their war council I found Stanley in that same vicinity Looking neither worse nor better than he had during our day of cooking Just to be sure I asked him How you doing Feeling dusty he admitted Awful dusty My father spotted the pair of us and called over Jick you hang on out here We got to go over the map but it wont take too long Into the tent he ducked with Paul Kratka and Ames following You want me to go get your sipping bottle I offered to Stanley referring to the one of whiskeytinged water in his saddlebag Mighty kind replied Stanley But it better wait And before I could blink he was gone from beside me and was approaching the tent where my fathers war council was going on Stanley stuck his head in past the flap door of the tent I heard Can I see you for part of a minute Mac Stanley its going to have to wait Were still trying to dope out our fire line for the morning That fireiine is what its about There was a moment of silence in the tent Then Pauls voice 488 For crying out loud Who ever heard of a fire camp where the cook gets to put in his two bits worth Mister I dont know who the devil you think you are but All right Paul my father umpired Hold on There was a moment of silence which could only have been a scrutinizing one My father began to say Stanley once we get this Mac you know how much it takes for me to ask A moment again Then my father All right Theres plenty of night ahead We can stand a couple of minutes for me to hear what Stanley has to say Paul you guys go ahead and map out how we can space the crews along the creek bottom I wont be long And bringing one of the gas lanterns out he came giving Stanley a solid lookingover in the white light Side by side the two of them headed out of earshot of the tent Not out of mine though for this I was never going to miss They had gone maybe a dozen strides when I caught up with them The three of us stopped at the west end of the camp Above us the fire had on its ni9ht face yet bright pretty No hint whatsover of the grim smoke and char itshowed by day Mac Im sorry as all hell to butt into your war council there I hate to say anything about procedure Particular to you But But youre determined toStanley whats on your mind The idea of tackling the fire down here on the creek first thing in the morning Stanley paused Then Mac my belief is thats not the way to go about it So where would you tackle it Stanleys Stetson jerked upward indicating the slope of grass across the North Fork from us Up there Now in the lantern light it was my fathers eyes that showed the so often did The thought repelled him The fire doubling its area of burn blackened both sides of the North Fork gorge instead of one More than thatStanley if this fire gets loose on the slope and up into that next timber it can take the whole goddamn country It can burn for miles My father stared up at the dim angle of slope but what was in his mind was 1910 Bitterroot Selway Phantom Woman all the smoke ghosts that haunt a fire boss Christamighty he said softly it could burn until snowfall Jerking his head around from that thought my father said Stanley dont get radical on me here What in the hell makes you say the fireline ought to be put up there on the mountain Mac I know you hate like poison to see any inch of the Two go up in smoke I hated it too But if you cant hold the fire at the base of the gulch its gonna break out onto the slope anyway The answer there is Im supposed to hold it Supposed to is one thing Doing its another Stanley these days weve got whats called the 10 am policy Forest Service 1 got religion about all this a few years ago The Major told us This approach to fire suppression will be a dividendpayer 490 So the rule is try to control any fire by 10 the next morning Yeah rules are rules agreed Stanley Or seemed to agree for I had heard my father any number of times invoke the second part of this station catechism And fools are fools My father pulled out a muchemployed handkerchief wiped his eyes and blew his nose Among the aggravations of his day was smoke irritation All right Stanley he said at last Run this by me again damn You I re saying give the fire the of Rooster Mountain Yeah more or less Use the morning and as much else of the day as you can get to build a wide fireline along that rocky top Its not as nasty a place as this gorge 11Christarnighty I cant pick places to fight a fire by whether theyre nasty or not Mac you know what I mean Stanley spelled it out for my father anyway That slope is dry as a torch If you put men down in this gorge and the fire sets off that slope behind them too youre going to be sifting piles of ashes to find their buttons I cant see how the fire could set off the slope across this much distance my father answered slowly I can Stanley said back Still stubborn as a government mule against the notion of voluntarily doubling the size of the Flume Gulch burn my father eyed back up at the slope of Rooster Mountain Hell if we just let the flame get out in that grass thens when well have a bigger fire 491 Youll have a bigger fireline And rocks instead of men to help stop it My father considered Then said Stanley Id rather take a beating than askyou this But I got to Are you entirely sober Sorry to say responded Stanley I sure as hell am He is I chimed in My father continued to confront Stanley I could see that he had more to say more to ask But there I was wrong My father only uttered The slope is something Ill think about and set off back to the tent Stanley told me he was going to turn inThis cooking is kind of a strenuous pastimeand ordinarily I would have embraced bed myself But none of this was ordinary I trailed my father to the war council once more and heard him say as soon as he was inside the tent Ideas dont care who their daddies are What would you guys say about this And he outlined the notion of the fireline atop the slope They didnt say much at all about it Kratka and Ames already had been foxed once by the Flume Gulch fire no need for them to stick their necks out again After a bit my father said Well Ill use it all as a pillow tonight Lets meet here before breakfast Meantime everybody take a look at that slope on the map 492 Pauls voice finally came Mac can I see you outside Excuse us again gents Out came my father and Paul again I made sure to catch up before the walkivg could turn into talking At the west edge of the camp Paul confronted my father Mac whichever way you decide on tackling this fire Ill never say a word against you But the fire record will You cant get around that If you dont have the crew down here to take the fire by its face in the morning Sipe is going to want to know why And the Majorif this fire gets away over that slope theyll sic a board of review on you Mac theyll have your hide My father weighed all this And at last said Paul theres another if If we can kill this fire Sipe and the Major arent going to give one good goddamn how we did it Paul peered unhappily from the flickering cracks in the night on the Flume Gulch side of us to the dark bulk of the slope on our other Youre the fire boss he said I am not sure I slept at all that night Waiting breath held any time I imagined I heard a rustle of wind Waiting for the mornill for my fathers firelire decision Waiting Christamighty Stanley Twenty loaves again Milk toast instead of mush to start with this morning Jick confirmed Stanley from the circle of lantern light where he was peering down into the cook book Then after the bread its Place 493 20 cans of milk and the same of boiler Yeah yeah yeah Let me get the damn slicing done first My father and Ames were the first ones through the breakfast line Amess men had come off the fireline earliest last night so they were to be the early ones onto it this morning Wherever that fireline was going to be I was so busy flunkying that it wasnt until a little break after Arness men and before Kratakas came that I could zero in on my father He and Ames brought their empty plates and dropped them in the dishwash tub My father scrutinized Stanley who was lugging a fresh heap of fried ham to the T table Stanley set down the ham and met my fathers regard with a straight gaze of his own Morning Mac Great day for the race aint it My father nodded to Stanley although whether in hello or agreement it couldnt be told Then he turned to Ames Okay Andy Take your bunch up there All the way to the top And next my father was corning around the serving table to where Stanley and I were saying Step over here you two Ive got something special in mind for the pair of you Shortly Wisdom Johnson came yawning into the grub line He woke up considerably when my father instructed him that the tall tall slope of Rooster Mountain just now looming up in the approach of dawn was where his water duty would be today h94 But Mac the fires over here it aint up there Its a new theory of fire fighting my father told him Were going to do it mail order Kratkas menwere soon fed It transpired that my father himself was going to lead this group onto the slope and show them where he wanted backfires lit First though he called Paul Eliason over I heard him instruct Have Chet tell Great Falls the same thing as yesterdayNo chance 10 am control today Mac Paul began Mac how about if I at least wait until toward that time of morning to call it in I dont see any sense in advertising whatwhat s going on up here My father leveled him a stare that made Paul sway back a little Assistant ranger Eliason do you mean to say youd delay information to headquarters Paul gulped but stood his ground Yeah In this case I would Now youre talking congratulated my father Send it in at 5 minutes to 10 My father turned and called to the crew waiting to go up the mountain with him Letis go see a fire Stanley this makes me feel like a coward You heard the man It was almost midafternoon the sweltering heart of so hot a day The rock formation we were perched on might as well have been a stoked stove Pony and the buckskin saddlehorse were tethered 495 in the shade of the trees below and behind us but they stood there drooping even so Stanley and I were chefs in exile This rock observation point of ours was the crownshaped formation above the line cabin where the two of us sheltered during our carnptending shenanigan How long ago it seemed since I was within those log walls bandaging Stanleys hand and wishing I was anywhere else I had heard the man My father when he herded the pair of us aside there at breakfast and decreed I want you two out of here this afternoon You understand If we did Stanley and I werent about to admit it My father the fire boss spelled matters out for us If the wind makes up its mind to blow or that fire takes a turn for some other reason it could come all the way down the gorge into this camp So when you get the lunches made clear out of here Naw Mac Stanley dissented Its a good enough idea for Jick to clear out but I Both of you stated my father Yeah well I started to put in Stanleys done his part but I could just as well Both of you my father reiterated Out of here by noon The long faces on us told him he still didnt have Stanley and me convinced Listen damn it Stanley you know what happened the last argument you and I had This time lets just dont argue Then more mild I need you to be with Jick Stanley 501 My father tried to head me off Old history now Jick If its that old then why cant I hear it You two need to know Ive been in the dark all damn surruner not knowing who did what to who when where any of it One time you send me off with Stanley but then we show up here and you look at him like hes got you spooked Damn it all to hell anyway tell you when I do get worked up there is not much limit Whats it all about Stanley over his dishwater asked my father You never told him huh My father shrugged and didnt answer Stanley gazed toward me You folks never enlightened you on the topic of me I just toldNo No they sure as hell havent McCaskills Stanley said with a shake of his head as if the name was a medical diagnosis I might of known you and Betd have padlocks on your tongues Mac Stanley my father tried theres no need for you to go into all that Yeah I think there is I was in Stanleys gaze again Phantom Woman he b83an I let that fire get away from me Or at least it got away Comes to the samea fire is the fire bosss responsibility and I was him Stanley turned his head to my father Then to me again Your dad had come up from his Indian Head district to be a fireline foreman for me So he was on hand when it happened When Phantom Woman blew up across that mountainside Stanley saw my question Naw I cant really say it was the 502 same as happened on that slope today Timber instead of grass different this and thatevery goddamn fire I ever been around is different from every other goddamn fire But anyhow up it blew Phantom Woman everywhere a11 the crew at my flank of the fireline had to run out of there like singed cats Run for their lives It was just a mess And then that fire went and went and went Stanleys throat made a dry swallow Burned for three weeks So thats the history of it Jick The blowup happened at my flank of the fireline It was over that that your dad and I had ourStanley faced my fatherdisagreement My father looked back at Stanley until it began to be a stare Then asked Thats it Thats what you call the history of it Stanleys turn to shrug My father shook his head Then uttered Jick I turned Stanley in For the Phantom Woman fire Turned him in How To who To headquarters in Great Falls Missoula The Major Anybody I could think of wouldnt you say Stanley Stanley considered Just about But Mac you dont What I persisted just for the fire getting away from him For that and My father stopped The booze Stanley completed As long as were telling tell him the whole of it Mac Jick my father set out this goes back a long way Longer than you know about Ive been around Stanley since I was what 503 sixteen seventeen Somewhere there Stanley confirmed There were a couple of years in there my father was going on when Iwell when I wasnt around home much I just up and pulled out for a while and Stanley Why was that This seemed to be my main chance to see into the McCaskill past and I wanted all the view I could get How come you pulled out My father paused Its a hell of a thing to have to say after all this with Alec But my father and I your grandfatherwe weJ e on the outs Not for anything like the same reason He did something I couldnt agree with and it was just easier all around for me to stay clear of the homestead and Scotch Heaven for a while Eventually he got over it and I got over it and thats all that needs to said about that episode A pause This one I knew sealed whatever that distant McCaskill fatherson ruckus had been Anyway Stanley took me on Started me here on the Two giving me any seasonal job he could come up with I spent a couple of years that way until we went into the war And then after when I was the association rider and your mother and I had Alec and then you came alongStanley suggested I take the ranger test I wanted to hear history did I A headful was now available Stanley had been the forest arranger the one who set up the Two Medicine National Forest Stanley had stood in when my father was on the outs with his father Stanley it had been who urged this father of mine into the Forest Service And it was Stanley whom my father hadIt never was any secret Stanley liked to take a drink I was hearing the elabration now But when I started as ranger at Indian Head and he still was the ranger at English Creek I started to realize the situation was getting beyond that There were more and more days when Stanley couldnt operate without a bottle at his side He still knew more about the Two than anybody and in the normal course of events I could kind of keep a watch on things up here and catch any problem that got past Stanley We went along that way for a few years Nobody higher up noticed or at least minded But its one thing to function day by day and another to have to do it during a big fire And Phantom Woman was big enough Stanley quietly dropped into telliq my Something was adding up in a way I didnt want it to After Phantom Woman What happened after Phantom Woman Stanley took his turn first Major Kelley tied a can to me Your employment with the US Forest Service is severed I believe is how it was put And I been rattling around ever since I guess He glanced at my father as if he had just throught of something further to tell him You remember the couple times I tried the cure Mac I tried it a couple more since It never took But you got by okay here I protested You havent had a real drink all the time weve been cooking But Ill have one the first minute I get back to the Busbys Stanley forecast And then a couple to wash that one down Naw Jick I know myself I ought to I been around myself long enough As if to be sure I accepted the sum of him Stanley gave it flatly In a pinch I can go dry for as long as I did here But ordinarily no I got a builtin thirst Now my father I never expected theyd come down on Stanley that hard A transfer some rocking chair job where the drinking wouldnt matter that muchsomething to get him off the English Creek district I couldnt just stand by and see both him and the Two country go to hell The expression on my father I suppose here was my first inkling that a person could do what he thought was right and yet be never comfortable about it He shook his head over what had to be said next erasing the inquiry that had been building in me You know how the Major is Put up or shut up When he bounced Stanley he handed me English Creek I wanted it run right did I Up to me to do it My father cast a look around the fire camp into the night where no brightness marked either Flume Gulch or the slope And here I still am trying to Again that night I was too stirred up for sleep Turning and turning in the sleeping bag the question beyond reach of questioner the two similar figures crowding my mind they and my new knowledge of them as awake as the night 5o6 Up against a decision my father had chosen the Two country over his friend his mentor Stanley against decision my brother had chosen independence over my father Rewrite my life into one of those other McCaskill versions and what would I have done in my fathers place or my brothers Even yet I dont know I do not know It may be that there is no knowing until a person is in so hard a place All that next morning my father had Kratkas crew felling suspicious snags in the burntover gulch and creek bottom and Amess men on the which slope to patrol for any sign of spark or smudge amid that char had been grass After lunch my father let half the EFFs go back to Great Falls He predicted The thanks Ill get is that headquarters will want to know why in holy hell I didnt get them off the payroll last night But the rest of the EFFs and the CCs he put back to watching the burn area Stanley and I recuperated from the lunch preparation and gradually started on supper neither of us saying anything worthwhile When the hot part of the afternoon had passed without trouble even my father was satisfied that the Flume Gulch fire was not going to rise from its black grave He came into camp with the rest of the EFFs Paul the show is all yours he delegated After supper you can have the CCs break the camp Im going to head into Gros Ventre now with the 507 rest of these EFFs Chet can tell Great Falls to get them from there And Paul my father checked his assistant as Paul started off to pass orders to the CCs Paul it was a good camp I was next on my fathers mental list Jick you might as well 1 come in with me Stanley can leave Pony off on his ride home Plainly my father wanted my company or at least my presence Okay I said Let me tell Stanley My father nodded Ill go round up Wisdom Hes somewhere over there bragging up Bouncing Betty to the CCs Meet us down at the truck The ride to town my father driving and Wisdom and I beside him in the cab of the truck was mostly nickel and dime gab Our route was the Noon Creek one a handier drive from the fire camp than backtracking over to English Creek Reminiscent exclamations from Wisdom when we passed the haystacks of the Reese place Already the stacks were turning from green to tan Then my father eyeing around the horizon and thinking out loud that August sure as hell ought to be done with heat and lightning by now More than that I have no memory of The be that I lulled off a little in the motion of that truck cab When we had goodbyed Wisdom and the other EFFs my father and I grabbed a quick supper in the Lunchery Oyster stew never tasted better which is saying a lot Before we could head home though stop my father said he had to by the Gleaner office Bill is going to want all the dope about too fire It may take a little while You want roo to pick you up at Rays after Im done I did 508 St Ignatius St was quiet in the calm of suppertime and just after except for one series of periodic whirrs Which proved to be Ray pushing the lawn mower around and around the Heaney front yard Behind him Mary Ellen was collecting the cut grass with a lawn rake bigger than she was I stepped into the yard and propped myself against the giant cottonwood in its shadowed side Busy as Ray and Mary Ellen were neither saw me Myself I was as tired as I have ever been yet my mind was going like a million After a minute I called across the law to Ray A little faster if you can stand it His grin broke out and from the far corner of the yard he came pushing the lawn mower diagonilly across to me somehow making in the back of his throat the clackaclackaclackaclacka sound of a horsedrawn hay mower Rayay protested Mary Ellen at his untidy shortcut across the lawn But then here she came raking up after him What do you think Ray asked when he reached the tree and me Had I better bring this out to Petes next summer and make hay with you Sounds good to me I said But thats next sunur1er I want to know where this one went to The light in the Heaney kitchen dimmed out another one came on in the living room then the murmur of Eds radio 7 pm you could bank on it I thought back to my last visit to this household you could set your clock by when I 509 pulled in from the Double W and the session with Alec that first Saturday night of the month Its been a real quick August Quicker than you know advised Ray Today is September Schools almost here The hell I guess I lost some days somewhere Three more days and I would be 15 years old Four more days and Ray and Mary Ellen and I would be back in school It didnt seem possible Time is the trickiest damn commodity The sound of Ed Heaneys radio in there should have been what I was hearing the night of the Fourth of July not almost to Labor Day Haying and supper at the Double W and the phone call to Alec and the forest fire and the revelations from Stanley and my father all seemed as if they should be yet to happen But theywere the past now in my mind like all that history in Toussaint s and Stanleys Can we feed you something Jick Ray asked in concern You look kind of hard used Dad and I ate uptown I said And hell be here any minute But I suppose I could manage to Just then the front porch screen door opened and Ed Heaney was standing there We all three looked at him in curiosity because with the screen door open that way he was letting in moths which was major disorderly conduct for him I will always see Ed Heaney in that doorway of light motionless there as if he had been pushed out in front of a crowd and was trying to think of what to say At last he did manage to bring out words and they were these 510 Ray Mary Ellen you better come in the house now Theyve started another war in Europe
