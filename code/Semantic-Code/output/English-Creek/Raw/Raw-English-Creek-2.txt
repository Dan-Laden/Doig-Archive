 158 This will mark the fifteenth Fourth of July in a row that Gros Ventre has mustered a creek picnic a rodeo and a dance Regarding those festivities ye editors wife inquires whether somebody still has her big yellow potatosalad bowl from last year the rodeo will feature 140 in prize money and the dance music will again be by Nola Atkins piano and Jeff Swan fiddle Gros Ventre weekly Gleaner June 29 I have to honestly say that the next few weeks of this remembered summer look somewhat pale in comparison with my Stanley episode Only in comparison though You can believe that I arrived back to English Creek from the land of sheepherders and packhorses in no mood to take any further guff from that father of mine What in Holy H Hell was that all about him and Stanley Meixell pussyfooting around each other the way they had when they met there on the mountain then before it was over my father handing me over to Stanley like an orphan Some counting trip that one I could spend the rest of the summer just trying to dope out why and what 159 and who if I let myself Considering then that my bill of goods against my father was so long and fresh lifes next main development caught me by entire surprise This same parent who had just lent me as a towing serviee for a whiskeyf ied geezer trying to find his way up the Rocky Mountainsthis identical father now announced that he would be off the English Creek premises for a week and I hereby was elevated into being the man of the house Your legs are long enough by now that they reach the ground he provided by way of justification the suppertime this was unveiled so I guess that qualifies you to run this place dont you think Weather brought this about as it did so much else that summer The cool wet mood of June continued and about the middle of the month our part of Montana had its solidest rain in years a toaddrowner that settled in around noon and poured on and on into the night That storm delivered snow onto the mountainsseveral inches fell in the Big Belts south beyond Sun River and that next morning here in the Two along the high sharp parts of all the peaks a white skift shined freshlooking as a sugar sprinkle You could bet though there were a bunch of perturbed sheepherders up there looking out their wagon doors at it and not thinking sugar Anyway since that storm was a straightforward douser without any lightning and left the forests so sopping that there was no fire danger for a while the desk jockeys at the national forest office in Great Falls saw this as a chance to ship a couple of rangers from the Two over to 160 Region headquarters for a refresher course Send them back to school as it was said Both my father and Murray Tomlin of the Blacktail Gulch station down on Sun River had been so assiduous about evading this in the past that the finger of selection now never wavered whatsoever it pointed the pair of them to Missoula for a week of fire school The morning came when my father appeared in his Forest Service monkey suituniform green hat pine tree badgeand readied himself to collect Murray at the Blacktail Gulch station from where they would drive over to Missoula together Mazoola he was still grumbling Why dont they send us to Hell to study fire and be done with it What I hear the mileage is probably about the same My mothers sympathy was not rampant All that surprises me is that youve gotten by this long without having to go Have you got your diary in some pocket of that rig Diary my father muttered diary diary diary patting various pockets I never budge without it And went to try find it I spectated with some anticipation My mood toward my father hadnt uncurdled entirely and some time on my own some open space without him around to remind me I was halfsore at him looked just dandy to me As did this firstever designation of me as the man of the house Of course I was well aware my father hadnt literally meant that I was to run English Creek in his absence Start with the basic that nobody ran my mother As for station matters my fathers assistant ranger Paul Eliason was strawbossing a fire trail crew not 161 far along the South Fork and the new dispatcher Chet Barnouw was up gettillS familiar with too lookout sectors and the telephone setup which connected them to too ranger station Any vital forest bus ire ss wruld be handled by ore of those two No I had no grandiose illusions I was to nake the check on Walter Kyles place sometime during the week and help Isidor Pronovost line out his pack string when he came to pack supplies up to the fire lookouts and do some barn cleaning and generally be on hand for anything my mother thought up Nothing to get wildeyed about Even so I wasnt prepared for what lay ahead when my father came back from his diary hunt looked across the kitchen at me said Step right out here for some free entertainment and led me around back of the ranger station There he went to the side of the outhouse being a little gingerly about it because of his uniform Turned Stepped off sixteen why exactly sixteen I dont know but likely it was in Forest Service regulations somewhere And announced Its time we moved Republican headquarters Howre your shovel muscles So here was my major duty of running English Creek in my fathers absence0 Digging the new hole to site the toilet over Let me be clear The job itself I didnt particularly mind Shovel work is honest sweat Even yet I would sooner do something manual than to diddle around with some temperamental damn piece of machinery No my grouse was of a different feather than I purely was perturbed that here was one more instance of my father 162 blindsiding me with a task I hadnt even dreamt of First Stanley now this outhouse deal Here was a summer it was beginning to seem like when every time I turned around some new and strange avenue of endeavor was under my feet and my father was pointing me along it and chirping Right this way All this and I suppose more was on my mind as my fathers pickup vanished over the rise of the Gros Ventre road and I contemplated my work site Moving an outhouse may not sound like the nicest occupation in the world But neither is it as bad as you probably think Here is the program When my father got back from Missoula we would simply lever up each side of the outhouse high enough to slip a pole under to serve as a skid then nail crosspieces to keep the pair of skids in place and with a length of cable attached to the back of the pickup snake the building over atop the new pit and let it down into place ready for business So the actual moving doesnt amount to all that much The new pit though Theres the drawback The pit my responsibility was going to take considerable doing Or rather considerable digging At the spot my father had paced to and marked I pounded in four stakes with white kitchen string from one to another to represent the outhouse dimensions Inasmuch as ours was a twoholer as was considered goodmannered for a family it made a considerable rectangle I guess about half again bigger than a cemetery grave And now all I faced was to excavate the stringedin space to a depth of about seven feet 163 Seven feet divided by unnn parts of five days what with the ride I had to make to check on Walter Kyles place and helping Isidor load pack string and general choring for my mother I doped out that if I did a dab of steady digging each afternoon I could handily complete the hole by Saturday when my father was due back Jobs which can be broken down into stints that way where you know that if you put in a certain amount of daily effort youll overcome the chore I have always been able to handle Its the more general errands of life that daunt me I dont mean to spout an entire sermon on this outhouse topic but advancing into the ground does get your mind onto the earth in more ways than one That day when I started in on the outhouse rectangle I of course first had to cut through the sod and once thats been shoveled out it leaves a depression about the size of a cellar door A sort of entryway down into the planet it looked like Unearthing that sod was the one part of this task that made me uneasy and it has taken me these years to realize why A number of times since I have been present when sod was broken to become a farmed field And in each instance I felt the particular emotion of watching that land be cut into furrows for the first time everever can we even come close to grasping what that meansand the native grass being tipped on its side and then folded under the brown wave of turned earth Anticipation fascination Part of the feeling can be described with those words or ones close to them It can be understood watching the ripping plow cut the patterns that will become a grainfield that the homesteaders 164 who came to Montana in their thousands believed they were seeing a new life uncovered for them Yet theres a further portion of those feelings at least in me Uneasiness The uneasy wondering of whether that rippingplow is honestly the best idea Smothering a natural crop grass to try to nurture an artificial one Not that I or probably anyone else with the least hint of a qualm had any vote in the matter Both before and after the Depressionwhich is to say in times when farmers had money enough to pay wageskids such as I was in this particular English Creek summer were merely what you might call hired arms brought in to pick rocks off the newly broken field And not only the newly broken for more rocks kept appearing and appearing In fact in our part of Montana rock picking was like sorting through a perpetual landslide Anything bigger than a grapefruitthe heftiest rocks might rival a watermelonwas dropped onto a stoneboat pulled by a team of horses or tractor and the eventual load was dumped alongside the field No stone fences built as in New England or over in Ireland or someplace Just raw heaps the slag of the plowed prairie I cite all this because by my third afternoon shift of digging I had confirmed for myself the Two countrys reputation for being a toupee of grass on a cranium of rock Gravel more accurately there so close to the bed of English Creek which in its bottom was 100 small stones We had studied in school that glaciers bulldozed through this part of the world but until you get to handling the evidence shovelful by shovelful the fact doesnt mean as much to you 165 I am dead sure this happened on the third afternoon a Wednesday because that was the day of the month the English Creek ladies club met There were enough wives along the creek to play two tables of cards arrl so have a rare enough chance to visit without males clu tteriJ up the scene club day always fourrl my motoo r in a fresh dress right after our noon meal ready to go CAlice Van Bebber stopped by to pick her up My Jick youre growing like a weed Alice crooned out the car window to me as my mother got in the other side Alice always was flighty as a chicken looking in a mirrorliving with Ed likely would do it to anybodyand away the car zoomed up the South Fork road toward Withrows as it was Midges turn to be hostess I know too that when I went out for my comfort station shift I began by doing some work with a pick Now I didnt absolutely have to swing a pick on this project With a little effort the gravel and the dirt mixed with it were shovelable enough But I simply liked to do occasional pick work Liked the different feel and rhythm of that tool operating overhand as it does rather than the perpetual reachdown andheave of shoveling Muscles too need some variety in life I have always thought So I was loosening the gravelly earth at the bottom of the hole with swings of the pick and on the basis of Alice Van Bebbers blab was wondering to myself why a grownup never seemed to say anything to me that I wanted to hear and after some minutes of this stopped for toward the r er station from breath And in looking up saw just starting down the rise of the county road a string of three horses 166 Sorrel and black and ugly gray Or reading back down the ladder of colors Bubbles and the pack mare and the saddle horse that Stanley Meixell was atop I didnt think it through I have no idea why I did it But I ducked down and sat in the bottom of the hole The moment I did of course I began to realize what I had committed myself to They say ninetenths of a person is above the ears but I swear the proportion sometimes gets reversed in me Not that I wasnt safely out of sight squatting down there when Id been standing up working my excavation by now was about shoulder deep on me No problem there No problem so long as Stanley didnt get a direct look down into the hole But what if that happened What if Stanley stopped at the station for some reason or other And say being stopped anyway he decided to use the outhouse and as he was headed out there decided to amble over to admire this pit of mine What then Would I pop up like a jackinthebox Id sure as the dickens look just as silly as one I was also learning that the position I had to squat in wasnt the worlds most comfortable And it was going to take a number of minutes for Stanley and company to saunter down from the rise and pass the station and go off up the North Fork road before I could safely stand p Just how many minutes began to interest me more than anything ele Of course I had no watch and the only other way I knew to keep track of time was to count it off like each second between lightning and thunder one athousand two athousandBut the problem there how much time did I have to count off That Id have to work out in my 167 head Alec style Lets see say Stanley and his horses were traveling Kelle 5 miles an hour which was the Major was always raising hell with the Forest Service packers about insisting they bygodandbydamn ought to be able to average that But the Major had never encountered Bubbles Bubbles surely would slow down any enterprise at least half a mile an hour dragging back on his lead rope like a tug of war contestant the way he did Okay miles an hour considering Bubbles and it was about a mile from the crest of the county road to down here at the ranger station then from here to where Stanley would pass out of sight beyond the North Fork brush was what another third of a mile maybe more like half a mile So now for Stanley to cover one mile at miles an hour would takewell 5 miles an hour would be 12 minutes 4 miles an hour would be 15 minutes round the mile an hour pace off to say 13 minutes then the other 13 to 12 mile would take somewhere around 6 minutes wouldnt it be So 13 and 6 19 Then 19 times 60 60 seconds to the minute for the total Id need to count to and that was was was 1100something This hunching down in a toilet hole was all getting dismal enough without me reciting one athousand two athousand three athousand all the way up to 1100something Besides I had no idea how much time I had already spent in the calculating Besides again numbers werent really what needed thinking on The point to ponder was why was I hiding anyway Why had I plunked myself into this situation Why didnt I want to face Stanley Why had I let the sight of him hoodoo me like this Some gab about the 168 weather inquire as to how his hand was getting along say I had to get back to digging and that would have been that But no here I was playing turtle in the bottom of an outhouse pit Sometimes theres nobody stranger in this wbrld than ourselves is So I squatted and mulled There this for sure about doing those two together they fairly soon convince youthat you can think better standing up Hell with it I eventually told myself If I had to pop up and face Stanley withmy face all pie sobe it T unkinked and came upright with some elaborate arm stretching as if Id just had a nice break from work down Then treated 111yself to a casual yawn and began eyeing around over the rim of the pit to detennine which direction I had to face embarrassment from And found noboqy No s tanley No Bubbles Nothing alive anywhere around except one fourteenyearold fool So my mother inquired upon return from her ladies cltJb everything peaceful around here Downright lonesome I said back Now let me tell of my mothers contribution to that week It ensued around midday on Thursday First thing that morning my fathers packer Isidor Pronovost showed up and I spent the front of the day working as cargodier for Isidor helping him make up packs of supplies to take up to the fire lookouts IsiisH Balance Isidor sermoned as he always did We got to balance the buggers 169 Jick thats every secret of it Harking back to my Bubbles experience I thought to myself dont I know it cThen Isidor was not much more than out of sight with his pack string when here came my mothers brother Pete English Creek was getting about as busy as Broadway Pete had driven into town from his ranch on Noon Creek on one errand or another and now was looping home by way of English Creek to drop off our mail and see how we were faring He stepped over and admired my progress on the outhouse hole0 Everybody on the creekll be wanting to patronize it You thought of charging admission Then handed me the few letters and that weeks Gleaner His doing so reminded me I was the temporary host of the place and I hurriedly invited Come on over to the house We no sooner were through the door 8f licPstatien than my mother was saying to Pete Youre staying for dinner arent you more as declaration than question So Pete shed his hat and offered that he supposed he could if its going to be something edible Pete got away with more with my mother than just about anyone else could including my father Park your tongue then she simply retorted and went to work on the meal while Pete and I chinned about the green year That topic naturally was staying near the front of everybodys coolest mind By now the weather service was declaring this June in arrl the wettest in almost as lol Montana since 1916 news which was more than welcome In Montana too much rain is just about enough All the while the country had been greening and greening the crop and livestock forecasts were flourishing too 170 Pete imparted that Morrel Loomis the biggest lamb buyer operating in the Two country had come up from Great Falls for a look at the Reese and Hahn and Withrow bands and that Pete and Fritz and Dode all decided to goahead and contract their lambs to Loomis on his offer of 2112 a pound Enough to keep me floating toward bankruptcy Dode had been heard to say which meant that even he was pretty well pleased with the price Beats last year by a couple of cents doesnt it I savvily asked Pete Uh huh and its damn well time Montana has got to be the champion next year country of the entire damn world How soon did you say youd be haying my mother interrogated without looking around from her meal work at the stove I wish now that she had in fact been facing around toward Pete and me for I am sure my gratitude for that question was painted all over my face When ever haying began I was to drive the scatter rake for Pete as I had done the sunnner before and Alec had for the few summers before that But getting a rancher to estimate a date when he figured his hay crop would be ready was like getting him to confess to black magic The hennning and hawing did have the basis that hay never was really ready to mow until the day you went out and looked at it and felt it and cocked an eye at the weather and decided this was as good a time as any But I also think ranchers cherished haying as the one elastic part of their year The calendar told them when lambing or calving would begin and shipping time loomed as another constant so when they had a chance 171 to be vagueeven Pete of the same straightforward lineage as my mother now was pussyfooting to the effect that all this rain hays going to be kind of late this yearthey clung to it Before the Fourth my mother narrowed the specification No I dont suppose It was interesting to see comments go back and forth between this pair like studying drawings of the same face done by two different artists Pete had what might be called the kernel of my mothers good looks ame neat nose apple cheeks roundish jaw but proportioned smaller thriftier The week after Could be Pete allowed Were you going to feed us sometime today or what Messages come in capsules as well as bottles The content of could be was that no hay would be made by Pete Reese until after the Fourth of July and until then I was loose in the world There during dinner it turned out that Pete now was on the question end of the conversation Alec been around lately 11Alec my mother reported in obituary tones is busy Riding the Range Day and night nAt least Our only hope of seeing him is if he ever needs a clean shirt 172 My personal theory is that a lot of misunderstanding followed my mother around just because of her way of saying Lisabeth Reese McCaskill could give you the time of day and make you wonder why you had dared to ask I recall ante when I was about eleven that we were visited for the morning by Louise Bowen wife of the ranger at the Indian Head district to the south of us Cliff Bowen was newly assigned onto the Two having held down an office job at Region headquarters in Missoula all the time before and Louise was telling my mother how worried she was that her yearold Donny accustomed to town and a fenced yard would wander off the station maybe fall into the Teton River I was in the other room more or less reading a Colliers and minding my own business but I can still hear how my mothers response suddenly seemed to fill the whole house Bell him There was a stretch of silence then until Louise finally kind of peeped Beg pardon I dont quite Put a bell on him The only way to keep track of a wandering child is to hear him Louise left not all too long after that and that was the extent of our visits from her But I did notice when my father drove down to borrow a sawset from Cliff a month or so later and I rode along that Donny Bowen was toddling around with a lamb bell on him Pete was continuing on the topic of Alec Well hes at that age Pete she headed him off I know what age my own son is 173 So you do Bet But the number isnt all of it You might try keep that in mind My mother reached to pass Pete some more fried spuds Ill try she allowed I Will Try When wed eaten and Pete declared Its time I wasnt here and headed home to Noon Creek my mother innnediately began drowning dirty dishes and I meanwhile remembered the mail Id been handed and fetched it from the sideboard where Id put it down There was a letter to my mother from Mr Vennaman the Gros Ventre principaleven though Alec and I were gone from the English Creek school my mother still was on its school board and so had occasional dealings with the education muckymucks in Gros Ventre and Conradand a couple of Forest Service things for my father probably the latestjelleygrams But what I was after was theGleaner thinking Id let my dinner settle a little while I read As us ual I opened to pt ge S Tha rewspaper was always 8 pages and ptge S was aJways the At Random page carryirg too editor Bill Reinkirg s Mn comments arrJ syndicated features about famous people or events arrl local history arrl even poetry or quotations if Bill felt like it Random definitely was th3 right word for it yet every week tta t page was a rragnet for a mini like mire Id been literary for maybe three minutes when I saw the names Mom You and Pete are in the paper She turned from where she was washing dishes and gave me her look that said you had now better produce some fast truth I pinned down the newsprint evidence with my finger See here 174 25 Years Ago in The Gleaner Anna Reese arrl children Lisabeth and Peter visited Isaac Reese at St Marys Lake for three days last weeko Isaac is providing the workhorses for the task of buildiq the roadbed from St Marys to Babb Isaac senls word through Anna that tre summers work on this arrl other Glacier National Park roads and trails is satisfactorilyo 175 As she read over my shoulder I thought about the journey that would have been those days Undoubtedly by democrat wagon all the way north from the Reese place on Noon Creek Past the landmark of Heart Butte across the Two Medicine River and then on even beyond Cut Bank Creek Very nearly to Chief Mountain the last peak that could be seen on the northern horizon I of course had been over that total route with my father but only a piece at a time on various riding trips and by pickup to the northernmost part But to do the whole journey at once by hoof and iron wheel a woman and two kids struck me as a notable expedition Sounds like a long time in a wagon I prompted cannily You never told me about thqt Didnt I And she turned and went back to her dishpan Well sometimes you could prompt my mother and sometimes you might as well try conversing with the stove poker I retreated into my hole so to speak Yet you know how it is when youre doing something your body can take care of by itself Your 176 mind is going to sneak off somewhere on its own As the rest of me dug mine was on that wagon journey with my mother and Pete and their mother There wouldnt have been the paved highway north to Browning and the Park then just the old road as the wheels of the freight wagons had rutted it into the prairie Some homesteads must have still existed between Gros Ventre and the Reservation boundary at Birch Creek but probably not many Those were the years when the Valier irrigation project was new and anybody who knew grain grew on a stem was over there around Lake Francis trying to be a farmer Mostly empty country then except for livestock all the way to Birch Creek and its ribbon line of trees Empty again from there north to Badger Creek where I supposed some of the same Blackfeet families lived then as now There near Badger the Reese wagon would have passed just west of the place where a century and some before Meriwether Lewis and the Blackfeet clashed That piece of Reservation country to us was simply grass until my father deduced from reading in a book of the Lewis and Clark journals that somewhere off in there near where Badger flows into the Two Medicine River was the place Lewis and his men killed a couple of Blackfeet over a stealing incident and began the long prairie war between whites and Indians Passing that area in a pickup on paved highway never made that history a seem real to me I would bet it was more believable from wagon Then up from Badger the high benches to where the Two Medicine trenched deep the landscape Maybe another day and a half of travel beyond that through Browning and west and then north across Cut Bank 177 Creek and over the divide to St Marys and there at the end of it all the road camp its crews and tents and workhorses In my nation I saw it as somewhat like a traveling circus but with godevils and scrapers and bther road machines instead of circus wagons And its ringmaster my grandfather Isaac Reese He was the only one of my grandparents yet alive when I became old enough to remember and I could just glimpse him in a corner of my mind A graymustached man at the head of the table whenever we had Sunday dinner at the Reeses using his knife to load his fork with food in a way which would have caused my mother to give Alec or me absolute hell if we had dared try it I gather though that Isaac Reese got away with ably more than that in lif e1 suppose any horse dealer worth his tation didand it was a thriving Reese ranch there on Noon Creek that Pete took over after the old mans death This Reese side of the family wandered into the conversation whenever someone would learn that my mother although she was married to a man only a generation or so away from kilts herself was just Scottish The other half my father would claim when he judged that she was in a good enough mood he could get away with it seems to be something like badger Actually that lineage was Danish Isak Riis departed Denmark aboard the ship King carl sometime in the 1880s and the pen of an immigration official greeted him onto American soil as Isaac Reese In that everybodyheadwestandgrabsomeland period counting was more vital than spelling anyway By dint of what his eyes told him on the journey west Isaac arrived to North Dakota determined on a living 178 from workhorses The Great Northern railroad was pushing across the top of the estern United Statesthis was when Jim Hill was promising to cobweb Dakota and Montana with railroad ironand Isaac began as a teamster on the roadbed His ways with horses and projects proved to be as sure as his new language was shaky My father claimed to have been on hand the famous time years later when Isaac couldnt find the words wagon tongue and ended up calling it de Godtamn handle to de Godtamn vagoncllWithin days after sizing up the railroad situation 11too old boy was borrcwing money right and left from anybcrlytwho 1d take his note to buy horses and more horsesmy father was always a ready source on Isaac I guess greatly grateful 00 have had a fatherinlaw he both admired and got entertairment fromarrl soon Isaac had his own teams and drivers workiqs on contract for the Great Northern Wren construction reached tre east face of the Roclcles the mountains held Isaac Why nobody in the family ever could figure out Certainly in Denmark re must mever have seen anything higher than a barnyard manure pile Arrl unlike some ot re r parts of Montana this one had no settlenent of Danes Though as my father pointed out maybe Isaacs reasons In any case while his horses and roon worked on west through Marias Pass as the railroad proceeded tcMard the coast Isaac stayed and looked around In a week or so re horsebacked south along the mountains toward Gros Ventre and out of that jourmy bought a homestead relinquishnent which became the start of the eventual Reese ranch Isaac Reese was either shrewd as hell or lucky as hell Even at my stage of life I am not entirely clear whether there is any appreciable difference between the two By whichever guidance he lit here in a 179 region of Montana where a couple of decades of projects were standing in line waiting for a man with workhorses The many miles of irrigation canals of the water schemes at Valier and Bynum and Choteau and Fairfield Ranch reservoirs 4ressavoys to Isaac The roadbed when the branch railroad was built north from Choteau to Pendroy Street grading when Valier was built onto the prairie All those Glacier Park roads and trails As each appurtenance was put onto the Two country and its neighboring areas Isaac was on hand to realize money from it And married a Scotchwoman to hang onto the dollars for him my father always injected at this point She was Anna Ramsay teacher at the Noon Creek school Her I knew next to nothing about Just that she died in the influenza epidemic during the war and that in the wedding picture of her and Isaac that hung in my parents bedroom she was the one standing and looking in charge while Isaac sat beside her with his mustache drooping whimsically Neither my mother nor my father ever said much about Anna Ramsay Reesewhich helped sharpen my present curiosity thinking about her trundling off to St Marys in that wagon Like my McCaskill grandparents she simply was an absent figure back there cast all the more into shadow by my fathers supply of stories about Isaac In a sense the first of those Isaac tales was the genesis of our family The night my father the young association rider was going to catch Isaac by ambush and request my mother in marriage Isaac greeted him at the door and before they were even properly sat down had launched into a whole evening of horse topics Clydesdales and Belgians and Morgans and fetlocks and withers and hocks ftd pastern Never tell me a 180 Scandinavian harbors no sense of humor t1 When my father at last managed to wedge the question in Isaac tried to look taken aback eyed him hard and repeated as if he was making sure marriage Or as my father said Isaac pronounced it mare itch Then Isaac looked at my father harder yet and asked Tell me dis Do you ever took a drink My father figured honesty was the best answer in the face of public knowledge Now and then yes I do Isaac weighed that Then he got to his feet and loomed over my father Vell took one now den And with Mason jar moonshine reached down from the cupboard the pairing that began Alec and me was toasted When I considered that Id done an afternoons excavating cally and mentally I climbed out and had a look at the progress of my sanitation engineering By now the pile of dirt and gravel stood high and broad the darker tone on its top showing todays fresh shovel work and the drier fadedout stuff beneath the previous days With a little imagination I thought I could even discern a gradation like layers on a cake of each stint of my shovelfuls of the Two country Mondays Tuesdays Wednesdays and now todays lightchocolate top Damn interesting the ingredients of this earth More to the immediate point I was pleased with myself that Id estimated the work into the right daily dabs Tomorrow afternoon was going to cost some effort because I was getting down so deep the 181 soil would need to be bucketed out But the hole looked definitely finishable I must have been more giddy with myself than I realized because when I went over to the chopping block to split wood for the kitchen woodbox I found myself using the axe in rhythm with a song of Stanleys about the gal named Lou and what she was able to do with her wingwangwoo When I came into the kitchen with the armload my mother was looking at me oddly Since when did you take up singing she inquired Oh just feeling good I guess 11 I said and dumped my cargo into the woodbox loud enough to try prove it What was that tune anyway Pretty Redwing I hazarded I think That brought a further look from her wnile Im at it I might as well fill the water bucket I proposed and got out of there After supper lack of anything better to do made me tackle my mother on that long ago wagon trip again That is I was doing something but it didnt exactly strain the brain Since hearing Stanley tell about having done that winter of hair work a million years ago in Kansas I had gotten mildly interested and was braiding myself a horsehair hackamore I was discovering though that in terms of entertainment braiding is pretty much like chewing gum with your fingers So182 Whered you sleep She was going through the Gleaner Sleep when That time When you all went up to St Marys I kept on with my braiding just as if wed been having this continuing conversation every evening of our lives She glanced over at me then said Under the wagon Really You Which drew me more of her attention than I was bargaining fqr Uh how many nights I got quite a little braiding done in the silence that answered that and when I finally figured I had to glance up I realized that she was truly studying me Not just taking apart with a look studyiIJg Her voice wasnt at all sharp when she asked Jick got your curiosity bump up Im just interested1 is all Even to me that didnt sound like an overly profound explanation so I tried to go on When I was with Stanley those days camptending he told me a lot about the Two About when he was the ranger It got me interested in uh old times What did he say about being ranger That he was the one here before Dad And that he set up the Two as a national It occurred to me to try her on a piece of chronology I had been attempting to work out ever since that night of my cabin binge What was Dad the ranger at Indian Head while Stanley still was the ranger here For a while Is that where I remember Stanley from 183 I Did you and Dad neighbor back and forth with him a lot Some What does any of that have to do with how many nights I slept under a wagon twentyfive years ago She had a reasonable enough question there Yet it somehow seemed to me that a connection did exist that any history of a Two country person was alloyed with the history of any other Two country person That some given sum of each life had to be added into every other to find the total But none of which sounded sane to say All I did finally manage was I just would like to know something about things then Like when you were around my age No doubt there was a response she had to bite her tongue to keep from making that she wasnt sure shed ever been this age I seemed to be at just now Instead camef All right That wagon trip to St Marys What is it you want to know about it Well justwhy was it you went Mother took the notion My father had been away up there for some weeks He often was contracting horses somewhere She rustled theGleaner as she turned a page About like being married to a ranger she added but lightly enough to show it was her version of a joke How long did that trip take then Now in a car it was a matter of a couple or three hours She had to think about that After a minute Two and a half days Two nights she underscored for my benefit under the wagon One at the TwoMedicine and one at Cut Bank Creek11 184 nHow come Cut Bank Creek Why not in Browning My mother held the opinion that the prairie was a more civilized place than Browning What did you do for food chuck We ate out of That old one from chuckwagon days with all the cattle brands on it Mother and I cooked up what was necessary before we left Were you the only ones on the road Pretty much yes The mail stage still was running then Somewhere along the way 1 met it She could nail questions shut faster than I could think them up Not deliberately I see now That was just the way she was A person who put no particular importance on having made a prairie trek and seen a stagecoach in the process My mother seemed to realize that this wasnt exactly flowering into the epic tale I was hoping for Jick thats all I know about it We went and stayed a few days and came back Went stayed came The facts were there but the feel of them wasnt What about the road camp I resorted to next What do you remember about that The St Marys area is one of the most beautiful ones with the mountains of Glacier National Park sheering up beyond the The world looks to be all stone and ice and water there Even my mother might have noticed some of that glory Here she found a small smile Just that when we pulled in Pete beganhelloing all the horses 185 She saw that didnt register with me Calling out hello to the workhorses in the various teams she explained He hadnt seen them for awhile after all Hello Woodrow Hello Sneezer Methusaleh Runt Copenhagen Mother let him go on with it until he came to a big gray mare called Second Wife She never thought the name of that one was as funny as Father did There is this about history you never know which particular ember of it is going to glow to life As she told this I could all but hear Pete helloing those horses his dry voice making a chant which sang across that road camp And the look on my mother told me she could too Not to be too obvious I braided a moment more Then decided to try the other part of that St Marys scene Your own mother What was she like That father of yours has been heard to say Im a second serving of her Well this at least informed me that old Isaac Reese hadnt gotten away with nearly as much in life as Id originally thought But now how to keep this line of talk goingWas she a leaper too No my mother outright laughed No I seem to be the only one of that variety Probably our best single piece of family lore was that my mother leaped in with the century The 29th of February of 1900 she was born on Which of course meant that except when each leap year showed 186 up she lacked a definite calendar date for her birthday She herself never made anything of that just let each offyear birthday be marked on whichever date seemed most convenient at the time February 28th or March 1st But either my father or Alec one year came up with the card cut idea So three years of every four the bunch of us congregated at the table after the supper dishes were done and my mother shuffled a deck of cards Likely not more than two or three quick riffles because there was a pretty abrupt limit on how much she was willing to fool around Then we all would make our predictions as to what manner of birthday year this seemed to betomorrow or the next dayand she cut the cards a heart or diamond delivering her a last of February birthday a club or spade a first of March This particular year had been a red one I recall because she said at the time So I dont even get a days grace any more It sobers me to realize that when she made that plaint about the speed of time she was not yet twothirds of the age I am now Why did I What The Gleaner was forgotten in front of her now her gaze was on 100 not her look that could skin a rock just a highly surprised onceover I swear that what Id had framed in mind was only further inquiry about my grandparents how Anna Ramsay and Isaac Reese first happened to meet and when theyd decided to get married and so on But somewhere a cog slipped and what had fallen out of my mouth instead was Whyd you marry Dad Well you know I now floundered searching for any possible shore what I mean kids wonder about something like that How we got here 187 Another perilous direction that OIe I dont mean uh how exactly More like why Didnt you ever wonder yourself Why your own mother and father decided to get married I mean how would any of us be here if those people back then hadnt decided the way they did And I just thought since were talking about all this anyway you could fill me in on some of it Out of your own experience sort of My mother looked at me for an eternity more then shook her head One of them goes head over heels after anything blonde the other one wants to know the history of the world Alec and you where did I get you two I figured I had nothing further to lose by taking the chance Thats sort of what I was asking isnt it All right She still looked skeptical of the possibility of conunon sense in me but her eyes let up on me a little All right Mr Inquisitive You want to know the makings of this family is that it I nodded vigorously She thought Then Jick a person hardly knows how to start on this But you know dont you that I taught most of thatthat one year at the Noon Creek school I did know that chapter That when my mothers mother Anna Ramsay Reese died in the flu epidemic of 1918 my mother came back from what was to have been her second year in college and became in her mothers stead the Noon Creek teacher If it hadnt been for that who knows what would have happened 188 she went qn But that did bring me back from college about the same time a longgeared galoot named Varick McCaskill came back from the folks were army still in here up the North Fork Scotch Heaven So Mac was back in the country and the two of us had known each othei oh all our lives really Though mostly by sight Our families didnt always get along But thats neither here nor there That springwhen this Mac character was hired as association rider Didnt get along I ought to have known better My interruption sharpened her right up again Thats another story Theres such a thing as a onetrack mind but honestly Jick you McCaskill men sometimes have notrack minds Now Do you want to Hear This Or 11You were doing just fine Real Dad got to be the association rider and then what All right then He got to be the association rider andwell he got to paying attention to me I suppose it could be said I paid some back Right then I yearned the impossible To have watched that doublesided admiration My mother had turned 19 the last of February or March 1 of that teaching year a little older than Alec was now though not a whole hellof a lot Given what a goodlooker she was even now she must have been extra special then And my father the cowboyhard to imagine thatwould have been in his early twenties a rangy redhead whod been out in the world all the way to Fort Leonard Wood Missouri Varick and Lisabeth progressing to Mac and Bet then to some secret territory of 189 love that I couldnt even guess at They are beyond our knowing those once young people who become our parents which to me has always made them that much more fascinating There was a dance that spring In my own schoolhouse so your father ever since has been telling me I have nobody to blame but myself She again had a glow to her as when shed told me about Pete helloing the horses Mac was on hand by then hed been hired by the Noon Creek ranchers and was around helping them brand calves and so on That dance she shrugged as if an impossible question had been askedthat dance I suppose did it though neither of us knew it right then Id been determined I was never going to marry into a ranch life Let alone to a cow chouser who didnt own much more than his chaps and hat And later I vowed never to get intereste Anyway nowhere he was in my own schoolroom Id never seen a man take so much pleasure in dancing Most of it with me need I say Oh and there was this I hadnt been around him or those other Scotch Heaveners while I was away at college and Id lost the knack of listening to that burr of theirs About the third time that night he said something I couldnt catch I asked him Do you always talk through your nose And then heput on a realburr and said back Lass it saves wearrr and tearrr on my lips Theyrrre in prrrime condition if yourrre everrr currriotis My father the flirt Or flirrit I must have openly gaped over this for my mother reddened a bit and stirred in her chair and declared 190 Well you dont need full detaiJs Now Ts that enough family history Not really You mean the two of you decided to get married because you liked how Dad danced You would be surprised how large a part something like that plays But no theres more to it than that Jick when people fall in love the way we did ittsI dont mean this like it sounds but itts like being siGk Sick in a wonderful way if you can imagine that The feeling is in you just all the time is what I mean It takes you No matter what you do what you try to think about the other person is there in your head Or your blood however you want to say it at the impossible againtheres no describing it beyond that And so we knew A summer of thata sunnner when we didnt even see each other that much because your father was up in the Two tending the association cattle most of the timewe just knew That fall we were married Here she sprung a slight smile at me And I let myself in forall these questions There was one though that hovered I was trying to determine whether to open my yap and voice it when she took it on herself My guess is you 1 re thirtking about Alec and Leona aren 1 t you Yeah sort of Lord knCJt1s trey imagine theyre in a downright epidemic of love my mother acknowledged Alec maybe is He 1 s always been all go and no whoa But Leona She cant be Shes too young and my mother scouted for aptness libberty Leona is in love with the idea of men not one man And thatsenough on that subject She looked acros s at me in a way that made my fingers quit even pretending they were 191 manufacturing a horsehair hackamore Now I have one for you Jick you worry me a little Huh I do You do All this interest of yours in the way things were I just hope you dont go through life paying attention to the past at the expense of the future That you dont pass up chances because theyre newand unexpected She said this next softly yet also more strongly than anything else Id ever heard her say Jick there isnt any law that says a McCaskill cant be as forwardlooking as anybody else Just because your father and your brother each in his own way looks to the past to find life you neednt They are both good men I love the two of themthe three of youin the exact way I told you about when your father and I started all ths But Jick be ready for your life ahead It cant all be read behind you I looked back at I wouldnt have bet I had it in me to say this But it did comeout Mom I know it all cant But some That next afternoon Friday was the homestretch of my digging It needed to be with my father due home sometime the next morning And so once more unto the bowels of the earth so to speak taking down with me into the outhouse pit an old shorthandled lady shovel Toussaint Rennie had given my father and a bucket to pack the dirt out with My mood was firstrate My mothers discourse from the evening before still occupied my thinking The other portion of me by now was accustomed to the pit work muscles making no complaint whatsoever and 192 bottomless in me that feeling you have when you are young that you can keep laboring on and on and on forever if need be The lady shovel I was using was perfect for this finishingoff work of dabbing dirt into the bucket To make it handy in his ditch riding Toussaint always shortened the handle and then ground off about four inches of the shovel blade cutting it down into a light implement about twothirds of a normal shovel but which still he proclaimed carries all the dirt I want to And working as I had been for a while each day without gloves to get some good calluses started now I had full benefit of the smooth old shovel handle in my bare hands To me calluses have always been one of the marks of true sunnner How long I lost myself to the rhytlun of the lady shovel and the bucket I dont know But definitely I was closing in on the last of my project bottoming the pit out nice and even when I stepped toward my ladder to heft up a pailful of dirt and found myself looking into the blaze face of a horse And above that a hat and grin which belonged to Alec Going down to visit the Chinamen huh Why did that get under my skin I can run that remark of Alecs through my ears a dozen times now and find no particular reason for it to be rilesome In my brothers lofty position Id likely have connnented something similar But evidently there is something about being come upon in the bottom of an outhouse hole that will unhinge me for I snapped right back to Alec Yeah we cant all spend our time roosting on top of a horse and 193 looking Wie Alec let up on his grinning at that Youre a little bit owly there Jicker You maybe got a touch of shovelitis I continued to squint up at him and had it framed in my mind to retort Is that anything like wingwangwoo fever when it dawned on me that Alec was paying only about halfattention to our conversation anyway His gaze was wandering around the station buildings as if he hadnt seen them for a decade or so yet also as if he wasnt quite seeing them now either Abstracted might be the twentyfive cent word for it A fellow with a lot on his mind most of it blonde and warm One thing did occur to me to find out How much is 19 times 60 1140 replied Alec still looking absent Why Nothing Damned if I was going to bat remarks back and forth with somebody whose heart wasnt in it so I simply asked What brings you in off the lone prairie propped an arm against the side of my pit J and waited Alec finally recalled that I was down there and maybe was owed some explanation for the favor of his presence so he announced I just cameby for that town shirt of mine Needit for rodeo day Christamighty The powers of mothers Barely a full day had passed since Mom forecast to Pete that it would take the dire necessity of a shirt to draw Alec into our vicinity and here he was shirtchaser incarnate 194 It seemed to me too good a topic to let him have for free What are you entering the pretty shirt contest this year Now Alec took a squint down at me from the summit of the horse as if I only then really registered on him No wisemouth the calf roping Hoohoo Here was going to be another Alec man9u ver just popular as all hell with our parents spending money on the entry fee for calf roping I guess that color of shirt does make calves run slower I deadpanned The garment in question was dark purplish about the shade of chokecherry juice Distinctive to put it politely Its in the bottom drawer there in ourthe porch bedroom Then I figured since I was being helpful anyway I might as well clarify the terrain for Alec Dads in Missoula But maybe youd already heard that huh But Alec was glancing around in that absentminded way again which was nettling me a little more every time he did it I mean you dont particularly like to have a person choosing when to phase in and out on you We had been brothers for about 14 56 years so a few seconds of consecutive attention didnt strike me as too awful much to expect of Alec4f Evidently so though He had reined his horses head house before he thought to ask Hows Moms mood Sweet as pie He might as well know there was an early limit on my aid to this visitation of his Hows yours I got nothing back from that Alec simply passed from sight his horses tail giving a last little waft as if wiping clean the field of 195 vision which the pit framed over me As I was reaching down to resume with my bucket of earth though I heard the hooves stop and the saddle creak Jicker Alees voice came Yeah I hear you been running the mountains with Stanley Meixell While I knew you couldnt have a nosebleed in the English Creek valley without everybody offering you a hanky for a week afterward it had never occurred to me that I too was automatically part of this public pageant I was so surprised by Alec knowing of my Stanley sojourn that I could only send forth another Yeah You want to be a little more choosy about your company is all Why I asked earnestly of the gape of the pit over me Two days ago I was hiding out from Stanley in this very hole like a bashful badger and now I sounded like he was my patron saint What the hell have you got against Stanley No answer floated down and it began to seem to me that this brother of mine getting awful damn cowboyish indeed if he looked down on a person for tending sheep camp I opened my mouth to tell him something along that line but what leaped out instead was Whys Stanley got everybody in this damn family so spooked Still nothing from above until I heard the saddle leather and hooves again moving off toward the ranger station The peace of the pit was gone Echoes of my questions to Alec 196 drove it out In its stead came a frame of mind that I was penned down here seven feet below the world in a future uthouse site while two members of this damn McCaskill family were resting their bones house inside etatiIJlfand the other one was gallivanting off in Missoula To each his own and all that but this situation had gotten considerably out of proportiqn The more I steamed the more a dipper of water and a handful of gingersnaps seemed necessary to damper me down And so I climbed out with the bucket of dirt flung it on the pile as if burying something smelly and headed into the house Your mind is still set my mother was saying as I came through the doorway into the kitchen Still is agreed Alec but warily Neither of them paid me any particular attention as I dippered a drink from the water bucket That told me plenty about how hot and heavy the conversation was in here A year Alec So she was tackling him along that angle again Delay and live to fight again another day Try college for a year and decide then Right now you and Leona think the world begins and ends in each other But its too soon to say after just these few months Its long enough Thats what Earl Zane likely thought the day before Leona dropped him for you That seemed to me to credit Earl Zane with more thought capacity than hed ever shown Earl was a year or so older than Alec and his brother Arlee was a year ahead of me in school and so far as 197 I could see the Zane boys were living verifications that the human head is mostly bone Thats past history Alec was maintaining I punctuated that for him by popping the lid off the Karo can the gingersnaps were kept in Then there was the sort of scrabbling sound as I dug out a handful And after that the little sharp crunch as I took a first bite All of which Alec waited out with the too patient annoyance of somebody held up while a train goes by Then declared Leona and I aintarent skim milk kids We know what were doing My mother took a breath which probably used up half the air in the kitchen Alec What youre doing is rushing into trouble You cant get ahead on ranch wages And just because Leona is horse happy at the moment doesnt mean shes going to stay content with a ranch hand for a husband Well get by Besides Wendell says hell boost my wages after were married This stopped even my mother though not for long Wendell Williamson she said levelly has nobodys interest at heart but his own Alec you know as well as anybody the Double W has been the ruin of that Noon Creek country Any cattle ranch he hasnt bought outright he has sewed up with a lease from the bank If Wendell hadnt got them somebody else would have Alec recited Yes my mother surprised him maybe somebody like yqu body who doesnt already have more money than he can count Somebody 198 whod run one of those ranches properly instead of gobbling it up just for the sake of having it Alec Wendell Williamson is using you the way he uses a handkerchief to blow his nose Once hes gotten a few years of work out of youanother kitchenclearing breath and evidently gotten you married off to Leona so youll have that gation to carry around in life tooonce hes made enough use of you and you start thinking in terms of a real raise in wages down the road youll go and hell hire some other youngster Youngster Now wait one damn min with his head full of cowboy notions Alec staying on at the Double Wis a dead end in life While Alec was bringing up his forces against all this I crunched into another ginger snap My brother and my mother sent me looks from their opposite sides of the room a convergence about as taut as being roped with two lassoes simultaneously She suggested Arent you supposed to be shoveling instead of demolishing cookies I guess See you around Alec Yeah Around Supper that night was about as lively as dancing to a dead march Alec had ridden off toward townLeonawardevidently altered not one whit from when he arrived except for gaining himself the rodeo shirt My mother was working out her mood on the cooking utensils I was a little surprised the food didnt look pulverized 199 when it arrived to the table So far as I could see I was the only person on the place whod made any true progress that day finishing the outhouse hole When I came in to wash up I considered announcing cheerfully Open for business out there but took a look at my mothers stance there at the stove and decided against the two of u just ate which if youre going to be silent is probably the best thing to be doing anyway I was doubly glad I had coaxed as much conversation out of her last night as I had I sometimes wonder if life is anything but an averaging One kind of day and then its opposite Likely though the mother of Alec McCaskill would not have agreed just then that life has its own simple average For by the time my mother washed the supper dishes and I was drying them I began to realize she wasnt merely in a maternal snit She was thinking hard about something And if I may give myself credit it occurred to me that her thinking deserved my Any new idea anybody in the McCaskill family could come up with deserved all encouragement Need me any more I asked as I hung the dish towel I thought I might ride up to check on Walters and fish myway home till toward dark The years longest day was just past twilight would go on for a couple or three hours yet No No go ahead Her cooks instinct roused her to add nyour father will be home tomorrow so catch us a big mess In those times a ie rson could ti he 1imi t was 2 5 fish a day And then she was back into too thinking Nothing was amiss at Walter Kyle 1 s p lace As I closed the door 200 on that tidy sparse room I wondered if Walter didnt have the right idea Live alone and let everybody else knock bruises on one another The fishing was as close to a cinch as fishing can ever be Since I was using an honesttoGod pole and reel and it was a feeding time of evening the trout in those North Fork beaver dams all but volunteered Do I even need to say out loud that I limited One more time I didnt owe my father a theoretical milkshake and there twentyfif th still was evening left when the gill of that trout was striqer threaded onto my I went to collect Pony from the tall meadow grass where she was grazing My mother still was in her big think when I came back into the ranger station toward the last of dusk I reported that the mess of cleaned fish were in a pan of water in the spring house then stretched myself in an obvious sort of way kissed her goodnight and headed for the north porch and my bed I honestly didnt want to be around any more heavy cogitation that day That north porch a screenedin affair had been built to take station house advantage of the summer shade on that side of the English Creek but in late spring Alec and I always moved out there to use it as our bedroom Now that he was bunking at the Double wr of course had the room to myself and I have to testify here that gaining a private bedroom goes far toward alleviating the absence of a brother Not just the privacy did I treasure though It seemed to me at the time and still does that a person could not ask for a better site than that one for days end That north porch made a sort of copperwire 201 bubble into the night world Moths would bat and bat against the screening especially if Id brought a coal oil lamp out with me Mosquitoes in the couple of weeks in early June when they are fiercest would alight out there and try to needle their way in and theres a real reward to lying there knowing that those little whining bastards cant get at you Occasional scutterings and whishes in the grass brought news of an owl or skunk working on the field mouse population out there beyond the lampshine Many an evening though I would not even light the lamp just use the moon when I went out to bed Any bright night filled the width of that porch with the shaggy wall of English Creeks cottonwoods and aspen and atop them like a the blunt black line of the other side of the water Out the west end the mountains stood Roman Reef and Billygoat and Phantom Woman Peaks behind it With Alecs cot folded away I had room to move mine longways into the east end of the room so that I could lie looking at the mountains and enjoy the bonus too that with my head there below the east sill the sunrise would overshoot me instead of beaming into my face I recall that this was a lampless night that I was flopping into bed without even any thought of reading for awhile more tired from the day than Id realized when I heard my mother at the phone Max Ill do it I still think your common sense has dried up and blown away But Ill Do It And whanged down the receiver as if her words might sneak back out of the telephone wire What that was about I had no clue Max The only Max I could 202 conjure up was Max Devlin the assistant supervisor at forest in Great Falls and why she would be calling him up this time of night just to doubt his connnon sense I couldnt figure But maybe the goround with Alec had put her into her mood to deliver the Forest Service a little of what she considered it generally deserved I definitely was not going back out there to inquire Sleep was safer My father arrived back from Missoula full of sass and vinegar He always came away from a Region eadquarters session avid to get back to the real planet again Even the fact that it was Saturday and he had a blank week of diary to catch up on didnt dent his spirits Easy enough after one of these Mazoola schools Lets seeMonday snored Tuesday tossed and turned Wednesday another restless day of sleep As for my handiwork out back he was duly impressed The entire dam Fort couldnt have dug better What ought I to tell about the days between then and the Fourth of July The outhouse got moved in good order fitting over my pit like a hen onto a fresh nest and I put in another shovel day of tossing the dirt into the old hole My father combed the Two up down and sideways checking on the fire lookouts and patrolling the allotments to see how the range was looking and siccing Paul Eliason and the CCC crews onto trail and road work and any other improvements that could be thought up Shearing time came and went I helped wrangle Dode Withrows sheep in the pens the shearers set up at the foot of the South Fork trail to 203 handle the Withrow and Hahn and Kyle bands then Pete came and took me up to the Blackfeet Reservation for a couple more days wrangling when his were sheared out there on the open prairie north of the Two Medicine River Nothing more was seen of Alec at English Creek My mother no doubt posted my father about the goingover she had given Alec when he came by for the shirt although a reaming like that has to be seen and heard to be entirely appreciated Beyond that I suppose the main news by the morning of the Fourth when the three of us began to ready to go to town for the holiday was that we were going For my father didnt always get the Fourth of July off it depended on fire danger in the forest I in fact was getting a little nervous about this year The cool summer turned itself around on the last day of June Hot and Down in Great Falls they had first a dust stormpeople trying to drive in from Helena reported hundreds of tumbleweeds rolling across the highway on Gore Hilland after that about fifteen minutes of thunderstorm with rain coming down as if from faucets But then the Falls receives a lot of bastardly weather we donto Particularly in sununer its site out there on the plains gives storms a chance to build and build before they strike the city The mountain weather was our concern and so much of May and June had been cool and damp that even this hot start of July wasnt a threatyeto AL etTf Final persuasion came from the holiday itself That fourth morning arrived as a good moderate one promising a day warm enough to be comfortable but nowhere near sweltering and my as we sat down to father said his It came complete with a sizable 204 grin and the words of it were Watch out Gros Ventie Herewe come I had a particular stake in a troublefree Fourth and parental good humor By dint of recent clean living and some careful asking and I suppose the example of soninrebellion provided to my parents by Alec I had won permission to make horseback sojourn into town in order to stay overnight with my best friend from school Ray Heaney As I cagily pointed out Then the morning after the Fourth I can just ride back out here and saveyou a trip into town to get me Strange I didnt see the logic of all this before connnented my mother Youll be saving us a trip we wouldnt have to make if you didnt stay in there in the first place am I right But it turned out that was just her keeping in practice Of course receiving permission from your parents is not the same as being able to hang onto it and I was stepping pretty lightly that morning to keep from inspiring anysecond thoughts on their part In particular as much as possible I was avoiding the kitchen and my mothers culinary orbit Which was sound Fourth of July policy in any case A reasoning person would have thought she was getting ready to lay siege to Gros Ventre instead of only going in there on a picnic My father ventured through for a cup of coffee and I overheard my mother say Why I said Id do this Ill never know and him respond Uh huh youre certainly downright famous for bashfulness and then her response in turn but with a little laugh And youre notorious for sympathy 205 As I was trying to dope that outmy mother bashful about a creek picnicmy father poked his head into where I was and asked How about tracking down the ice creamer and putting it in the pickup calculate I did so meanwhile trying soon I could decently propoBe that I start my ride to town I didnt want to seem antsy about it the other hand I sure desired to get the Fourth of July underway But here came my father out andover to me at the pickup Then commemorated himself with me forever by saying Here Better carry some weight in your pocket so you dont blow away With which I was handed a half dollar I must have looked my startlement Other Fourth of Julys if there was any spending money bestowed on Alec and me it was more on the order of 10 If there was any Call it shovel wages My father stuck his hands in his hip pockets and studied the road to town as if hed never noticed it before You might as well head on in Well see you there at the park Then as if in afterthought Why dont you ride Mouse he can stand the exercise When you are fourteen you take a step up in life whenever you can find it and meanwhile try to keep a mien somewhere between At last and Do you really mean that I stayed adult and stately until I was behind the barn and into the horse pasture then gave in to a grin the dimension of a jackalanterns A by God fullscale horse mine for the holiday In the corner of the pasture where Pony was grazing she lifted her head to watch me but I called Forget it midget and went on over and bridled Moue 206 Mouse and I scooted rightalong that road toward GrosVentrea He was a fast walker besides elevating me and my spirits more than Id been used to on Ponyo The morningmidmorning and past by was full of sun but enough breeze was following along English Creek for a person to ride in pure comforto The country still looked just glorious All the valley of English Creek was fresh with hayo Nobody was mowing quite yet except for the one damp green swath around Ed Van Bebbers lower field where he had tried it a week too early as he did every yeqr o I was more than ready for the Fourth A lot seemed to have happened since that evening back at the start of June when I looked up and saw Alec and Leona parading down the rise to join us for a family One whole hell of a loto No longer was I even sure that we four McCaskills quite were a family It was time we all had something else on our minds besides ruckus Alec plainly already did the way he intended to trig up on behalf of Leona and a calf o And given how my mother was whaling into the picnic preparation and my father was grinning like a Chessy cat about getting the day off from rangering and I was strutting atop this tall horse with coinage heavy in my pocket the Fourth was promising to do the job for the other three of us It is nonewthought to saythat life goes on Yet thats where it does go In maybe an hour and a half better time than I would have 207 thought possible for that ride in from the English Creekstation Mouse and I were topping the little

groves that already rose old and tall along English Creek before Gros Ventre was everthought of the streetside plantation produced almost a roof over the town This cottonwood canopy was particularly

enterprise The set of bank buildings marking what might be called the down of downtown the First National Bank of Gros Ventre in tan brick and cattycorner from it the red brick of what had been the English Creek Valley Stockmens Bank The Valley Stockmens went under in the early 1920s when half of all the banks in Montana failed and the site now was inhabited if not exactly occupied by Sandy Stotts onechair barber shop The style in banks in those times was to have a fancy doorway set into the corner nearest the street intersectionGros Ventres pair of bank buildings stared down each others throats in exactly this fashionand when Sandy took over the Valley Stockmens building he simply painted barberpole stripes on one of the fat granite pillars supporting the doorway What have I missed Of course also there on the Valley Stockmens block the newspaper off ice with its name proclaiming on a plateglass in same typeface as its masthead Gleaner Next to that a more recent enterprise Pauline Shaws Moderne Beauty Shoppe The story was that when Bill Reinking first saw his new neighboring sign 211 hestuck his head in the shop to ask Pauline if she was sure she hadnt left an e off Beauty I heard somebody say once that the business section of every Western town hed ever looked as if it originated by falling out the back end of a trucko Not so with Gros During those Depression years GrosVentre did look Weathered by all it had been througho But to me the town also held a sense of being what it ought to beo Of aptness maybe is the Not fancy not Steadyo Settlement here dated back to whensome weary freight wagoneer pulled in for the night at the nice creekside sheltered by cottonwoods As the freighters trail betweenFort Shaw on the Sun River and southern Alberta developed this site became a regular waystop nicknamed The Middle since it was about midway between Fort Shaw and Canadaalthough some of us also suspect that to those earlyday wagoneers the place seemed like the middle of Gros Ventre grew to about a thousand people when the homesteadersbegan arriving to Montana in droves in the first decade of this centurymy mother could remember in her childhood coming to town and seeing wagon after wagon of immigrants heading out onto the prairie a white rag tied on one spoke of a wagonwheel so the revolutions could be counted to measure the bounds of the claimed and that population total never afterward varied more than a hundred either WqYo Nor varied much in quality either I think it can be said Gros Ventre simplytended to draw people who where there from choice rather than merely lack of imaginatiQno Settlers from Scotch Heaven or other homestead areas that played out who had come in and found some 212 way to start over in lif eo Others who had moved into town for high school for their kids then stayed Qno The store people The ranch hands and sheep herders who hung aroundto live out their spans when they werebeyond worko The south to north route Mouse and I were taking through Gros Ventre I now have to say saved for the last what to me was the best of the towno A pair of buildings at the far end of the east side of Main Street last outposts before the streethighway made its curve and zoomed from Gros Ventre over the bridge across English Greek The night during our campjacking trip when I was baptizing my interior with alcohol andStanleyMeixell was telling me the history of the Two Medicine National Forest from day one a surprise chapter of that tale about the hostelrythat held the most prominent site in Gros Ventre Stanleys arrival to town when he first came here to the Two was along the route Mouse and I had just done from the south and as Stanley rode along thelength of Main Street here at the far end a broad falsefront with a verandah beneath it was proclaiming beer liquors cigars meals at all N 0 R T H E R N H 0 T E L lunches sedgwick prqpo put up ours Looks like it could kind of use a prop all right Stanley observed to a biboveralled idler leaning against one of the porch postso Who turned out tobe the exact wrong person to make that joke to C Eo Sedgwick himselfo 213 If my enterprise dont suit

around in thoseoveralls because what he really liked about being a hotelier was the opportunity to be his own maintenance mqno But what Sedge erected still sat this Fourth when I was atop Mouse across the end of Main Street as a kind of civic astonishme11t A story fandango in stone quarried from the gray cliffs near where English Creek joins the Two Medicine River half a block square this reborn Sedgwick hostelry with round towers at each corner and a swooping pointed ornament in the middle rather like the spike on those German soldiers helmetso Even yet strangers who dont know that the Pondera County courthouse is twentytwo miles east in Conrad assume that Sedges hotel is ito Sedge in fact contributed to the civic illusion by this time not daubing a sign all across the front of the place Instead only 2lh an inset of chiseled letters rainbowing over the entranceway I C I w H G 0 D u E s s E Sedge sold out in 1928 to a family from Seattle who seemed to somehow eke a living out of that big gray elephant of a hotel even after hard times hito About 1931 Sedge died of pleurisy and almost as if shed been waiting just offstage his widow emerged as one of Gros Ventres most citizens and certainly the looniest Lila Sedgwick was a tall bony womano Her build always reminded me of Abraham Lincolno Almost any day she could be seen downtown three or four times some days six or eight for she no sooner would get home than she would forget about having just gone for the mail or on someother errand andwould go forit againo In her long oldstyle dresses with those Lincoln arms and elbowspoking out she inevitably was a figure of fun although the one and only time I saidsomething smart about her my mothers frown closed me down in a hurryo LilaSedge is not to be laughed at she said not in her stonedvoicebut just sort of instructively The clouds have settled on her mindo I dont know where my mother got that but always after when I 215 would see Lila Sedge along thisstreet for thethird time in anhour or gandering up at a cottonwood tree as if shes never encountered one before I would wonder about how it was to have a clouded mind Somewhere in there I supposed a bruisecolored thunderhead that was Sedges deatho Maybe mares tails high away in the past where she was a girlo Fluffs which carried facesaunts uncles mates any of us she happened to meet on the streetin and out of her recognitiqno Until my mothers wordsabout Lila Sedge I had never thought of theweather of the brain but more and more I have come to believe init But enough on thato The Sedgwicks and their namesake hotel provided Gros Ventre its one titanicbuilding and its roving human landmarko The enterprise south across the street from the Sedgwick House ministered to the town internallyo TheMedicine Lodge saloon gave GrosVentre its rough section of town in the thriftiest manner possibleo I would calculate that in Great Falls it took aboutfour blocks of First Avenue South to add up into a neighborhood of similar local notoriety Actually as with any pleasure emporium the wickedest thing about the Medicine Lodge was its reputationo TheMedicine Lodge had waitedout Prohibition behind boarded windows but Tom Harrymore than brought it back to light and lifeo Also maybe after those dry years thetown was thirsty for a saloon with a bit of flairo Tom Harry had come over from running a bar and some said a taxi dance jointas well at the Fort Peck dam project Supposedly all he brought with him was a wad of cash and the picture of Franklin Delano 216 Roosevelt which had adorned the wall of his Fort Peck enterprise Be that as it rrey in tlE Medicine Lodge FDR was promptly joined on the wall by a minor menagerie of stuffed animal heads Tom Harry acquired Severalbuck deer and an antelope and a mountain sheep and a bobcat snarling about the company he was in not to mention the sixpointelk head which set off arguments every hunting season about how much his absent body would weigho As matters proved out alollS with Tom Harry also came a set of invisible rules of which every so often somebody would stray acrossa I think of the night when my father and I were entering the Medicine Lodge and met a stranger with a cigarin his mouth being forcibly propelled into the streeto It turnedout that although Tom Harry himself went around under ablue cigarette hazetailormades no Fort Peck bartender ever had time to roll his ownhe would not tolerate cigar smokea Initself taxidermy herdpopulated the Medicine Lodge considerablyo But the placealso held a constant legion of the living more or lesso These setters as my father called the six or eight guys who sat around in was not above stepping in for a beer after our Luncherymeal and if nobody officiallooking was on hand Tom Harry didnt seem to mindmy being with setters always occupied the stools at the far end of the bar and anybody who entered got long gazes from them as if theywere cataloguing the human Decapitated animals and owlish geezers do not I realize sound like much of a decqro AndyettheMedicine Lodge did three timesas much 217 business as Spengers orthe Pastime both much more respectable places back downtown I suppose it is and ever will be the habit of the race people gravitate to a certain place to do their drinking and logic will never veer themo Atleast one night a week in the Medicine Lodge gravitation amounted to something more like an avalancbea Saturday night thirsts converged fromeverywhere in the Two countiyo Hay hands who had come in for a bath

beenbuilding up the calluses on their elbows all week just for thiso Always asufficient cast of characters for loud dialogues occasional shoving matches and eventual outs Maybe you couldnt get away with cigar smoke in the Medicine Lodge but you could with whatcountedo Turning east past the Sedgwick House and the Medicine Lodge Mouse and I now were into the Heaneys side of towno An early priest had persuaded the Catholic landowner whoplatted this particular hood to name the streets after the first missions in Montana which in turn borethe names of saints This created what the current Gros Ventre postmaster Chick Jennings calledtherepeater part of town with mailing addresses such asSta MarySt Sto Peter Sto and Sto Ignatius Sto 218 Itwas at the end of Sta IgnatiusSt that the Heaney housestood a white one with sills of robins egg blue Ed Heaney owned the lumber yard and so was the oneperson in town in those Depression years some access to paipto The robins egg blue hadbeen ashipping mistake bythe manufacturerit is a shade pretty delicate to put up against the weather of Montanaand Ed lugged the can home and made the best of ito The place looked empty as I rode up which was as I expectedo Rather than the creek picnic the Heaneys always went out to a family shindigat Genevieves parents farm quite a ways east of Gros Ventre on the Conrad roado So with Ray out there I wouldnt link up with him until the rodeo and I simply slung my warbag inside the Heaneys back porch and got back on Mouse again and went picnicking Cars and pickups and trucks were parked so thick that they all but swamped the part of town around the It is nice about a horse that you can park him handilywhile Henry Ford still would be circling the block andcussipg I chose a stand of high grass between the creek bank andthe bigcottonwoods just west of the park and pastured Mouse on a tie of rope short enough that he couldnt tangle it around anything and long enough for him to graze a little Then gave him a final proud pat and headed off to enlist with the picnickerso Some writer or anotherput down that in the history of Montana the onlydefinite example of civic uplift was when the Virginia City vigilantes hung the Henry gang in 1864 I think that over219 states a bito You can arrive into themost scruffy of Montana towns and delve around a few minutes and in all likelihood find a public park of some soto In Gros Ventres instance the park was a circle of maybe an acre fronting on English Creek just west of Main Street and the highway bridge one last oasis before the road arrowed north into the plains and benchlanqs In recent years WPA crews had made it a lot more of a park than it had been clearing out the willows which were takingover the creek bank and then laying in some riprap to keep the spring runoff And someone during that WPA work came up with an idea Ive not seen before or since There near the creek where a big crippled cottonwood leaneda windstorm had ripped off its main branchesa crew sawed the tree off low to the ground leaving a broad stump about two feet high then atop the stump was built a speakers pulpit a slatted round affair somewhat on the order of a ships crowsneto The one and only time I saw Senator BurtonKo Wheeler who some people thought might become President if Roosevelt ever stopped being we were let out of school to hear him give a speech fromthis speaking stumpo From where I had left Mouse I emerged into the creekside corner of the park where the stump pulpit stood and I stopped beside it to have a look around A true Two country Fourth of July The trees were snowing Fat old cottonwoods stood all along the arc between the park and the neighborhood while younger trees were spotted here and there 220 across the rest of the expanse as if they had been sent out to be shadebearers The day was providing just enough breeze into the treetops to rattle them a little and make them shed their cotton wisps out throughthe air like slow snow Through the cottonfall the spike of tower atop the Sedgwick House stuck up above one cottonwood among the trees at the far side of the park As if that tree had on a party hat As for people the park this day was a bunch of islands of them I literally mean islands The sunnner thus far had stayed cool enougl that even a just warm day like this one seemed so unaccustomed that it was putting people into the shade of the cottonwoods each gathering of family and friends on their specific piece of dappled shade like those cartoons of castaways on a desert isle with a single palm tree I had to traipse around somewhat helloing people and being helloed before I spotted my mother and my father sharing shade and a spread blanket with Pete and Marie Reese and Toussaint Rennie near the back of the park Among the greetings my fathers predominated Thank goodness youre here Petes been looking for somebody to challenge to an ice cream making contest So before I even got sat down I was off on that tangent Come on Jick Pete said as he reached for their ice cream freezer and I picked up ours anybody who cranks gets a double dish We took our freezers over near the coffee and lemonade table 221 where everybody elses was This year I should explain was the turn of English Creek and Noon Creek to provide the picnic with ice cream and beverage Bill Reinking who despite being a newspaperman had some fairly practical ideas was the one to suggest the system that instead of everybody and his brother showing up at the Fourth armed with ice creamers and coffee pots and jugs of lemonade each part of the connnunity take a turn in providing for all Now one year the families west of Main Street in Gros Ventre did the ice cream coffee and ade the next year the families east of Main Street the one after that those of us from English Creek and Noon Creek and then after us what vzas called the rest of Creation the farm families from east and south and north of town and anybody else who didnt fit some other category So for the next while Pete and I took turns with the other ice cream manufacturers cranking and cranking Lots of elbow grease and jokes about where all that fancy wrist work had been learned Marie shortly came over on coffee dutyshe was going to do the making my mother would serve after everybodyd eatenand brought along a message ftom my father and Toussaint They say a little faster if you can stand Lt Pete doffed his Stetson to them in mock gratitude The holiday definitely was tuning And even yet I can think of no better way to begin a Fourth of July than there among virtually all of our English Creek neighbors Not Walter Kyle up on the mountain with his sheep and not the Hebners who never showed themselves at these creek picnics and not the Withrows who must have been delayed some way But everybody else The South Fork folks other than the WithrowsFritz and Greta Hahn Ed and Alice Van Bebber Then the 222 population of the main creek those who merely migrated downstream here to the park so to speak Preston and Peg Rozier Charlie and Dora Finletter Ken and Janet Busby and Bob and Arleta I had halfwondered whether Stanley Meixell might show up with the Busbys and was relieved that he hadnt Don and Charity Frew The Hills arrived last while I was still inventorying the crowd JL leaning shakily on his wife Nan Set her down JL somebody called referring to the ice creamer the Hills had brought with them well do the twirling I get to shivering much more than this JL respondedand I can just hold the goddamn thing in my hands and make ice cream In truth JL s tremble was constant and almost aguelike by now It is terrible to see an ailment fastened onto a person and riding him day and night I hope not to end up that way life over and done with before existence is But that was not the thought for this day If a sense of life of the blood racing beneath your skin is not with you at a Fourth of July creek picnic then it is never going to be When Pete and I finished ice cream duty and returned to the blanket my father had Toussaint on the topic of what the Fourth of July was like when Gros Ventre and he were young Phony Nose Gorman Toussaint was telling Is he one you remember My father shook his head Before my time Much of Toussaints lore was before anyones time 223 TimGorman Toussaint elaborated Cox and Flowerees foreman a while Down on Sun River Froze his nose in that 86 winter Some doctor at Fort Shaw fixed him up Grafted skin on I saw him after the surgery was good But Phony Nose Gorman he was called He was the one the flagpole broke with There across the Lodge where the garage is now He was climbing it to put Deaf Smith Mitchells hat on top On a bet Those times they bet on the sun coming up Toussaint Rennie this day looked maybe sixtyfive years old at least a dozen yet had to that He was one of those chuckling men you meet rarely able to stave off time by perpetually staying insuch high humor that the years didnt want to interrupt him From that little current of laugh always purling in him Toussaints face had crinkled everywhere it could Tan and wrinkled deep that face like a gigantic walnut The rest of Toussaint was the general build of a potbelly stove I suppose his girth had been increasing steadily for some while without our really noticing for he hadnt yet let it interrupt life He still was riding the ditches of the Blackfeet Reservations Two Medicine irrigation project his shorthandled shovel sticking out of a rifle scabbard as his horse plodded the canal banks Allotting a footandahalf head of water to each farm ditch plugging gopher holes or muskrat tunnels in the canal bank with gunny sacks of dirt keeping culverts from clogging in a land of scarce water a ditch riders job was vital above most others and Toussaint apparently 224 was going to hold his until death made it drop from his hand In about the way that shovel was carried in that scabbard the history of the Two country rested there in Toussaints memory handy to employ And sharpened by steady use It never was clear to me how Toussaint isolated way to hell and gonehe bached out there a few miles west of where the highway crossed the Two Medicine River about 15 miles from Browning and a good 30 from Gros Ventrecould know news from anywhere in the Two country as fast as it happened Whatever the network was my father called it moccasin telegraph Toussaint was its most durable conductor He came to the Two in the time of the buffalo a boy eight or so years old when his family roved in from somewhere in the Dakotas The Rennies were part French my father thought they might have started off as Reynauds mostly tribal haze Of their Indian background Toussaint himself was only ever definite in declaring himself rtot a Blackfeet which had to do with the point that the Two Medicine woman he married Mary Rides Proud was one The usual assumption was that the Rennie lineage was Metis for other Metis families had ended up in this general region of Montana after the Riel rebellion in Alberta was put down in 1885 But count back across the decades and you found that Toussaint already had grown to manhood here in the Two country by the time the Mounties were hanging Louis Riel and scattering his followers Toussaint himself was worse than no help on this matter of origin for all he would say was to claim pedigree from the Lewis and Clark expedition I come down from Meriwether Lewis himself My grandfather had red 225 hair Thinking back on it now I suspect the murk of Toussaints lineage was carefully maintained For the one thing unmistakable about the Rennie family line was its knack for ending up on the side of the winners in any given contest of the Montana frontier The prairie was so black with buffalo it looked burnt I was with the Assiniboines we came down on the buffalo from the Sweetgrass Hills one Toussaint tale would relate and the next The trader Joe Kipp hired me to take cattle he was selling to the Army at Fort Benton He knew I kept Indians from stealing them Able to straddle that way Toussaint had a view into almost anything that happened in the early Two country He was with the bull teams that brought the building materials for the original Blackfeet Reservation agency north of Choteau before there was a Choteau or a Gros Ventre Ben Short was the wagon boss He was a good cusser After the winter of 86 Toussaint freighted cowhides off the prairie by the thousands That was what was left in this country by spring More cowhides than cows He saw young Lieutenant John J Pershing and his Negro soldiers ride through Gros Ventre in 1896 herding a few hundred woebegone Crees north to push them back over the line into Canada Each creek those soldiers crossed English Creek and Birch Creek and Badger Creek and all of them some more Crees leaked away into the brush He saw the canals come to the prairie the eightythousand acre irrigation project that built Valier from scratch in 1909 and drew in trainloads of homesteaders Pretty 226 quick theywondered about this Dust blew through Valier there plates were turned facedown on the table until you turned them up to eat off of One tree the town had Mrs Guardipee watered it from her wash tubs And the Two Medicine canal he himself had patroled for almost a quarter century the ditch rider job he held and held in spite of being not a Blackfeet It stops them being jealous of each other With me in the job none of them is The first blats of sheep into this part of Montana were heard by Toussaint I think 1879 People called Lyons down on the Teton Other sheepmen came fast Charlie Scoffin Charlie McDonald Oliver Goldsmith Cooper The first survey crews he watched make their sightings 1902 men with telescopes and Jacobs staffs The first Fourth of July you ever saw here my father was prompting When was that do you think Toussaint could date it without thinking Custers year 76 We heard just before the Fourth All dead at the Little Bighorn Everybody Gros Ventre was just Barclays hotel and saloon Men took turns coming out of the saloon to stand sentry To look north Here Toussaint leaned toward Petes wife Marie and said in mock reproach For Blackfeet All of us echoed his chuckle The tease to Marie was a standard one from Toussaint Married to Pete she of course was my aunt and if Id had 1000 aunts instead of just her she still would have been my favorite More to the point here though Marie was 227 Toussaints granddaughter and the only soul anywhere in that family who could get along with him Most of Toussaints sons wouldnt even speak to him his daughters had all married out of his orbit as rapidly as they could and down through the decades any number of his Rides Proud inlaws had threatened to shoot him Toussaint claimed he had a foolproof antidote to such threats I tell them bullets can fly more than one direction I myself remember that the last few years of her life Toussaint and his wife Mary didnt even live under the same roof whenever my father and I stopped by their place Toussaint was to be found in residence in the bunkhouse Thus all the evidence said that if you were a remove or two from him Toussaint could be a prince of the earth toward you but anybody sharing the same blood with him he begrudged Except Marie Marie was thin and not particularly darkher father was Irish an off ice man at the agency in Browningand only her black hair which she wore shoulderlong brought out the Blackfeet ancestry and whatever farther east Indian heredity it was that Toussaint transmitted So her resemblance to Toussaint really was only a similar music in her voice and the same running chuckle at the back of her throat when she was pleased Yet be around the two of them together for only a minute and you knew without mistake that here were not merely natural allies but blood kin There just was something unmistakably alike in how each of them regarded life As if they had seen it all before and shared the amusement that things were no better this time around But Toussaints story of the first Fourth wasnt quite done 228 I took a turn at sentry I was in there drinkirg with them In Barclays joint Already an oJrl nnn ne Fifteeno Ancient as Jick Marie murmured with a smile in my direction If she but kmw Maybe my toot with Stanley that night in the cabin didnt break any saloon records but it was spree enough for a starter 0Jick has a few months to go yet my mother corrected Maries observation I 1m getting there as fast as I can I defended drawirg a laugh from our assemblage As you can see an all but perfect Fourth of July picnic was commencirgo I say all but because the year before Alec had been with us iretead of off S irking Leona The only awareness him this year was tlE way people took sone care not to mention him to my parents o 229 the good mood among the cluster of us was about to get better My mother turned to Marie and asked Do you suppose these scenery inspectors have earned any food Well take pity on them Marie agreed and the picnic provisions began to emerge from the pair of grub boxes The blanket became like a raf tload of food except that such a cargo of eating likely would have sunk any raft There were the chickens my mother spent part of the morning frying delectable young spring fries with drumsticks about the thickness of your This very morning too Toussaint had caught a batch of trout in the Two Medicine and now here they beckoned fried up by Marie Blue enamel broilers of fish and fowl side by side The gateposts of heaven Maries special three bean salad the pinnacle of how good beans can taste My mothers famous potato salad with little new green onions cut so fine they were like sparks of flavor New radishes sweet and about the size of a marble first of Maries garden vegetables A dozen and a half deviled eggs arrayed by my mother A jar of homecanned pickled beets a strong point of my mothers A companion jar of crab apple pickles a distinction of Maries A plate of my mothers cinnamon rolls A loaf of Maries saffron bread Between the two a moon of Reese homechurned butter A lard pail of fresh donuts by Marie A gooseberry pie from my 230 My eyes feasted while the rest of me readied to My father urged Dive in Toussaint and the passing of dishes got underway Been a while since breakfast Pete proclaimed when he had his plate loaded Im so excited to see food again Im not sure I 11 be able to eat Too bad about you Marie said in that soft yet takeitorleaveit way so like Toussaints And my mother didnt overlook the chance to put in Wait well sell tickets People will line up to see Pete Reese not eat Come on now Bet ame the protest from Pete I have never eaten more than I could hold As they should do at a picnic the conversing and the consuming cantered along together in this fashion I think it was at the start of the second plateload when we were all letting out dubious hmmms about having another helping of this or that but then going ahead and having it that Pete asked my father if fire school in Missoula had made him any smarter than he was before Airplanes my father announced Airplanes are the firefighting apparatus of the future at least according to this one hoosier we heard from over there The hell Hows that gonna work I didnt say it was going to work I just said what the hoosier told us Theyre going to try parachutistslike these guys at fairs Say on urged Toussaint squinting through a mask of eager puzzlement Toussaint always was avid to hear developments of this 231 sort as if they confirmed for him the humorous traits of the human race That radio stuff he had declared during the worst of the drought and the dust storms it monkeys with the air Dries it out all that electric up there just now gettirg 8oeF iv LJashintJfon th f to test all this out my father continued his report of latest upintheair science Send an airplane with a couple of these parachutists over a mountain smoke and see if they can get down there and tromp it out before it grows to a real fire Thats the cheery theory anyhow Pete shook his head They couldnt pay me enough to jump out of one of those117f11Hell Pete the jumping would be easy money The landing is the only drawback My father readied to plow into another of Toussaints trout but first offered as if in afterthought Fact is I told them Id volunteermy mothers full skepticism sighted in on him now waiting to see if there was any color of seriousness in thisif the parachute was going to be big enough for my saddlehorse and paciftring too The vision of my father and assorted horses drifting down from the sky the way the cottonwood fluffs were floating around us set everybody to laughing like loonies Nextit was Toussaints inning again The mention of horses reminded him of a long ago Fourth of July in Gros Ventre when everybody caught horse race fever How it happened first they matched every saddle horse against every other saddle horse Ran out of those by middle of the afternoon Still plenty of beer and daylight left Then 232 somebody got thenotion Down to thestable everybody Brought out the stagecoach Bridled them put boys on them bareback Raced them against each other the length of Main Street The Toussaint It was hard to know To bet on the horse or how high the boy would bounce Rhich tickled us all again Difficult to eat on account of laughing and to laugh on account of eating Give me that dilennna anytime All this horse talk did remind me about Mouse and I excused myself to go picket him onto another patch of grass Truth to tell getting myself up and into motion also would shake down some of the food in me and make room for more back on that scene as I wended my way to the edge of the park where Mouse was tethered I have wished someone among us then had the talent to paint the portrait of that picnic A group scene that would have preserved those faces from English Creek and Noon Creek and Gros Ventre and the outeast farming country and yes Toussaints from the Two Medicine That would convey every one of those people at once and yet also their separateness Their selves I guess the ward should be I dont mean one of those phoneybaloney gilt concoctions such as that one of Custer and all his embattled and doomed troopers there at the Little Bighorn which hangs in threefourths of the saloons I have ever been in and disgusts me every single time To my mind Custer can he done justice only if shown wearing a tall white dunce 233 cap But once I saw in a magazine Look or Life or one of those dead ones what one painter tried in this respect of showing selves He first painted little pictures of tropical flowers in pink and other pastels wild roses I guess would be our closest comparison flower here in the Two country Some several hundred of those he painted Then when all these were hung together in the right order on the wall the flower colors fit together from picture to picture to create the outline of a tremendously huge snake In any picture by itself you could not see a hint of that snake But look at them together and he lay kinked across the entire wall mightier than the mightiest python That is the kind of portrait I mean of the creek picnic Not that very many of those people there in the park could be called the human equivalent of flowers nor that the sum of them amounted to a colossal civic snake But just the point that there that day they seemed to me each distinctly themselves and yet added up together too I have inquired though and so far as I can find nobody ever even thought to take a photograph of that day When I came back from retethering Mouse my parents and Pete and Marie were in a fourway conversation about something or other and Toussaint was spearing himself another trout out of the broiler His seemed to me the more sensible endeavor so I dropped down next to him to inflict myself on the chicken supply I was just beginning to do good work on my favorite piece of white meat a breastbone when Toussaint turned his head toward me The potato salad had come to rest 234 nearest my end of the blanket and I reached toward it expecting that he was going to ask me to pass it to him Instead Toussaint stated quietly You are a campjack these days Probably I went red as an apple I mean good christamighty Toussaints words signaled what I had never dreamt of moccasin telegraph had the story of my sashay with Stanley Everything that coursed through me in those moments I would need Methusalehs years to sort out Questions of source and quantity maybe hogged in first How the hell did Toussaint know And what exactly did he know My dimwitted approach to a bobwire fence in an electrical storm My tussle with Bubbles My alcoholic evening in the cabin No he couldnt know any of those in detail Couldhe unnerving The possibility of Toussaint having dropped some mention of that last and biggest matter my night of imbibing into the general conversation while I was off tending Mouse made me peer toward my motherctNo real reassurance there Her mood plainly had declined since the parade of the food onto the blanket she now was halflistening to my father and Pete and halfgazing off toward the ripples of English Whatever was occupying her mind I could only send up prayers that it wasnt identical to the topic on mine Geography next How far had the tale of JickandStanley spread Was I traveling on tongues throughout the whole damn Two country Hear about that McCaskill kid Yeah green as frog feathers aint 235 he You wonder how they let him out of the house by himself And beyond that philosop4y If I was a Toussaint topic just what did that constitute The mix of apprehension and surmise was all through me Illus a flavor of something which seemed surprisingly like pride Better or worse part of me now was in Toussaints knowledge his running history of the Two In there with Phony Nose Gorman and the last buffalo hunt and the first sheep and the winter of 86 and Lieutenant Black Jack Pershing and the herded Crees andand what did that mean Being a part of history at the age of fourteen years and ten months why had that responsibility picked me out They say when a cat walks over the ground that will be your grave a shiver goes through you As I sat there that fine July noon with a breastbone forgotten in my hand Toussaint again busy eating his trout after leaving the track of those six soft words across my lifeYou are a campjack these daysyes I shivered My fathers voice broke my trance If Toussaint and Jick ever delicacy would getdone eating for winter we could move along to the part of the meal Some fancy handleturning went into the making of that ice cream you know Or at least so I hear by rumor My mother was up declaring shed bring the cups of coffee if a certain son of hers would see to the dessert Toussaint chuckled And put up a hand as I started to clamber to my feet ready to bolt off to fetch dishes of ice cream bolt off anywhere to get a minute of thinking space to myself Do you know Beth Toussaint began stopping her and my heart 236 at the same time do you knowyour potato salad was goqd A picnic always slides into contentment on ice cream All around us as each lieth batch of people finished dessert and coffee men flopped onto their backs or sides while the women sat up and chatted with one another T though I wasnt doing any sliding or flopping just sitting there boltupright trying to think things through My head was as gorged as my stomach which was saying a lot My father though acted as if he didnt have a thing in the world on his mind To my surprise he scootched around until he had and his hat over his face room to lie flat then sank back with his head in my mothers lap Pretty close to perfect he said Now if I only had an obedient wife whod relieve me of these dress shoes li T take them off you my mother vowed youll be chasing after them as they float down the creek Thisis what I have to put up with allthe time Toussaint came his voice from under the hat Shes as independent as the moon My mother answered that by sticking out a thumb and jabbing it between a couple of his ribs which brought a whuw out of him 237 Down at creekside the high school principal Mr Vennaman was stepping up into the stump rostrum Time for the program evidently I tried to contain at the back of my mind the cyclone of thoughts about Toussaint and mocassin telegraph and myself always a day of pleasure Mr Vennamans voice began to reach those of us at the back of the park This is a holiday particularly American Sometimes if the person on the stump such as I am at this moment doesnt watch his enthusiasm it can become a little too much so I am always reminded of the mock speech which Mose Skinner a Will Rogers of his day proposed for this nations one hundredth birthday in 1876 Any person who insinuates in the remotest degree that America isnt the biggest and best country in the world and far ahead of every other country in everything will be filled with powder and touched off When the laughing at that died down Mr Vennaman went on We dont have to be quite that ardent about it I think But this is a day we can simply be thankful to be with our other countrymen A day for neighbors and friends and family Some of those neighbors in fact are here with a gift of song for us Mr Vennamen peered over toward the nearest big cottonwood Nola can the music conunence This was interesting For under that towering tree sat a piano Who came up with the idea I never did know but some of the Gros Ventre men had hauled the instrumentof course it was one of those old upright onesout of Nola Atkins front room and now here it was on the bank 238 of English Creek and Nola on the piano bench readying to play Id like to say Nola looked right at home but actually she was kept busy shooing cottonwood fluff off the keys and every so often thered be a plink as she brushed away a particularly stubborn puff of it Nonetheless Nola bobbed yes she was set I think it has to be said that the singing at events such as this is usually a pretty dubious proposition and thats more than likely why some outoftown group was invited to perform at each of these Fourth That way nobody local had anything to live down This years songsters the Valier Mens Chorus now were gathering selves beside Nola and the piano Odd to see them up there in that role farmers and water company men in white dress shirts and with the pale summits of their foreheads where hats customarily sat Their voices proved not to be golden but not really unlistenable either The program though inadvertently hit our funny bones as much as it did our ears Because the choruss first selection was I Cannot Sing the Songs of Long Ago and then as if offering proof they wobbled next into Loves Old Sweet Song The picnic crowd blossomed with grins over that and I believe I discerned even a trace of one on Nola Atkins at the piano Mr Vennaman came back up on the stump thanking the Valerians for that memorable rendition and introducing yet another neighbor our guest of honor this day Emil Thorsen the sheepman and state senator from down at Choteau rose and declared in a voice that could have been heard all the way downtown that in early times when he was 239 first running for off ice and it was all one county through here from Fort Benton to Babb instead of being broken up into several as it is now hed have happily taken up our time but since I cant whinny any votes out of you folks any more Ill just say Im glad to be here among so many friends and compliment you on feeding as good as you ever did and shut myself up and sit down And did Mr Vennaman popped to his feet again leading the handclapping and then saying Our next speaker actually needs no introduction Im going to take a lesson from Senator Thorsen and not bother to fashion one Two traits always marked Mr Vennaman as an educator the bow tie he perpetually wore and the way even saying hello on the street he seemed to be looking from the front of a classroom at you Now he peered andeven went up on his tiptoes a bit as if calling on someone in the bacifow of that classroom and sang out Beth McCaskill L knew L hadnt heard that quite right Yet here she was getting up from beside my father and smoothing her dress down and setting off toward the speakers stump with folded sheets of paper clutched in her business hand No doubt about it I was the most surprised person in the state of Montana right then But Pete and Marie were not far behind and even Toussaints face was squinched with curiosity What L floundered to my father Did you know Shes been sitting up nights writing this he told me with a creameating grin Your mother the Eleanor Roosevelt of English Creek She was on the stump now smoothing the papers onto the little stand being careful the creek breeze didnt snatch them She looked like she had an appointment to fight panthers but her voice began 240 steady and clear My being up here is anybodys suggestion but my own It was argued to me that if I did not make this talk it would not get made That might have bten the better idea But Maxwell Vennaman not to mention a certain Varick McCaskill has the art of persuasion I have been known to tell that husband of mine that he has a memory so long he has to tie knots in it to carry it around with him Well all now see just how much my own remembering is made up of slip knots Chuckles among the crowd at that A couple of hundred people being entertained by my mother a minute before I would have bet the world against it But I do say this I can see yet as clearly as if he was standing in long outline against one of these cottonwoods the man I have been asked to recall Ben English Many others of you were acquainted with Ben and the English family Sat up to a dinner or supper Mae put on the table in that very house across there Heads turned nodded The English place was directly before lE across the creek from the park Ore of the Depression 1 s coWltless vacant remnants with a walkedaway look to it If you were driving north out of Gros Ventre the English place came so quick set in there just past the highway bridge that chances were you wouldnt recognize it as a ranch rather than a part of the town But from the park the empty buildings across there seemed to call their facts over to us The Englishes all dead or moved away The family after them felled by the Depression Now the land leased by Wendell Williamson One more place 241 which had supported people now populated by Double W cows Or my mother was continuing or dealt with Ben for horses or cattle or barley or hay But acquaintance doesnt always etch deep and soat Max Vennamans request I have put together what is known of Ben English His is a history which begins where that of all settlers of the West of America has to elsewhere Benson English was born in 1865 at Cobourg in Ontario in Canada He liked to tell that as he and his brothers one by one left home their mother provided each of them with a Bible a razor whatever money she could and some knitted underwear My mother here looked as if she entirely approved of Ben Englishs mother Ben English was seventeen when he followed his brother Robert into Montana to Augusta where Robert had taken up a homestead Ben found a job driving freight wagon for the Sun River Sheep Company from the supply point at Craig on the Missouri River to their range in the mountains He put in a year at that and then at eighteen he was able to move up to driving the stage between Augusta and Craig She lifted a page went right on as if shed been giving Fourth of July speeches every day of her life Atop there with six horses surging beneath him seemed to be young Ben Englishs place in the world Soon with his wages of forty dollars a month he was buying his own horses With a broke team in the lead and his green ones in the other traces he nonetheless somehow kept his reputation as a driver you could set your clock by Here she looked up from her sheets of paper toglance over to Senator Thorsen Ben later liked to tell that a bonus of stage driving was its civic On election day he was able to vote when the stage made its stop at the Halfway Rouse Then again when it reached Craig Then a third time when he got home to AugusEa When the laughter at that was done my mother focused back down to her pages There was a saying that any man who had been a coach driver was qualified to handle the reins of heaven or hell either one But Ben English as so many of our parents did made the choice halfway between those two He homesteaded In the spring of 1893 he filed his claim southwest of here at the head of what is now called Ben English Coulee The particulars of the English homestead on Bens papers of proof may sound scant yet many of us here today came from just such beginnings in this country A dwelling house stable corrals miles of wire fences 30 acres of hay cut each total value 800 Around the time of his homesteading Ben English married Mae Manix of Augusta and Ben and Mae moved here to the place across the creek in 1896 Their only child Mary was born there in 19011 Here my mother paused her look fastened over the heads of all of us on the park grass toward the trunk of one of the big cottonwoods 243 farthest back As if in the way shed said earlier someone was standing in outline against the gray bark A lot of you can remember the look of Ben English A rangy man standing well over six feet and always wearing a black Stetson always with a middle crimp He sometimes grew a winter beard and in his last years he wore a mustache that made him look like the unfoolable horse dealer he was Across thirtysome years my f atherIsaac Reeseand Ben English knew each other and liked each other and tried to best each other Put the pair of them together my mother used to say of their visits and they would examine a horse until there was nothing left of it but a hank of tail hair and a dab of glue Once when my father bought a horse with an odd stripe in its face Ben told him he was glad to see a man of his age taking up a new occupationraising zebras My father got his turn back when Ben bought a dark bay Clydesdale that stood twentyone hands high at the shoulder very likely the hugest horse there ever has been in this valley and upon asking what the horses name was discovered it was Benson Whenever my father saw Ben and the Benson horse together he called out Benson andt Benson but tank Godt vun of tem vears a hadt Of all the crowd I am sure my father laughed loudest at this Lsaac Reese tale and Pete was nodding in confirmation of that accent he and my mother had grown up under Our speaker of the day though was sweeping onward Anyone who knew Ben English more than passingly will recall his knack for nicknames For those of you old enough to remember them around town Glacier Gus Swenson and Three Day Thurlow both were Chuckles christened that way by Ben English recognition spattered 244 amid the audience Glacier Gus was an idler so slow that it was said he wore spurs to keep his shadow from treading on his heels Three Day Thurlow had an everlasting local reputation as a passable worker his first day on a job a complainer on this second and gone sometime during his third Bens nicknaming had no thought of malice behind it however He did it for the pleasure it gave his tongue In any event in their paupers graves Glacier Gus and ThreeDay each lie buried in a suit given by Ben English She put the page she had just finished beneath the others and the next page she met with a little bob of her head as if it was the one shed been looking for all this time So it is a justice of language that a namer himself lives on in an extra name Originally this flow of water was simply called Gros Ventre Creek to go with the townsite But it came to be a saying as the sheepmen and other travelers would pass through here that they would stop for noon or the night when they reached Englishs Creek An apostrophe is not the easiest thing in the world to keep track of and so we know this as English Creek She paused again and I brought my hands up ready to clap that sounding to me like the probable extent of the Ben English history But no she was resuming Do I never learn My mother had her own yardstick as to when she was done with a topic L have a particular memory of Ben English myself I can see him yet riding past our ranch on Noon Creek on his way to his cattle range in the mountains leading a string of cayuse packhorses carrying block 245 salt On his way back he would ride intoour yard and pass the time of day with my father while still sitting in his saddle but hardly ever wouldhe climo down and come in His customary explanation was that he had to get home and move the water He seemed to feel that if he stayed in the saddle he indeed was on his way to that irrigating task My father had his head cocked in a fashion as if what she was reciting was new to him I figured that was just his pride in her performance hut yetAnd that memory leads to the next of Ben English in his fields across from us here moving the water Guiding the water it might be better satd For Ben English used the water of his namesake creek as a weaver uses woql With care With respect With patience Persuading it to become a product greater than itself Once more she smoothedthe page she was reading frqm Greater than itself As Ben English himself became greater than himself From the drudgery of a freight wagon to the hell deck of a stagecoach to a dryland stead to a ranch of green waterfed meadows that nicely supported a family that was the Montana path of Ben Englih Following his ability trusting in it to lead him past the blind alleys of life This is the day to remember a man who did it that way Ras I the only one to have the thought brim up in me then That somehow Alec McCaskill and the Double W had joined Ben English inthis speech Whether or not my mother had returned to the irrigation theme 246 BillReinking has been kind enough to find for me in theGleaner files something which says this better than I can It is a piece that I remembered was published when the first water flowed into the ditches of the Valier irrigation project Who wrote it is not known It is signed simply Homesteader Among the hundreds no thousands who were homesteading this country then maybe Homesteader isnt quite as anonymous as Anonymous But awfully close It is titled The Lord of the Fieldu deep breath It reads nThe irrigator is lord of his field A shovel is his musket gumboots are his garb of office shanks mare is his steed To him through the curving laterals the water arrives mysteriously without sign of origin or destination But his canvas dam placed with cunning causes the flood to hesitate seek and with an eager whisper pour over the ditch bank and onto the grateful land The man with the shovel hears the parched earth drink He sees its face of dusty brown gladden to glistening black He smells the odor of life as the lands plants take the water in green embrace He feels like a god exalted by this power of his hand and brain to create I manfflade rainyet humble as even a god must be under the burden of such power I honestly believe the only breath which could be discerned in that crowd after that was the one my mother let out Now she locked her attention to her written sheets and the words it gave her next were Ben English is gone from us He died in the summer of 1927 of 247 a strained heart Died to say it plainly of the work he put into this country as so many have My own father followed Ben English to the grave within two years Some say that not a horse in the Two country has had a rgood lookingover since their passing Which was one of the more barbed things she could have said to this audience full as it was of guys who considered themselves pretty fancy horsemen But she of course said it anyway and sailed on Ben English is gone and the English place stands empty across there except for the echoes of the auctioneers hammer A comment with larger barbs yet on it Ted Muntz whose First National Bank had foreclosed on the English place from the people Mrs English sold it to without doubt was somewhere in this audience And all out among the picnic crowd I saw people shift restlessly as if the memory of the foreclosure auctions the Depressions hammer sales was a sudden chate My father by now was listening so hard he seemed to be frozen an ice statue wearing the clothing of a man which confirmed to me that not even he knew how far my mother was headed with this talk English Creek is my second home she was stating now as if someone arguing the point with her for you all know that Noon Creek is where L was born and grew up Two creeks two valleys two claims on my heart Yet the pair are also day and night to me as examples of what has happened to this country in my lifetime Noon Creek nowisall but empty of the families I knew there Yes there is still the Reese name on a Noon Creek ranch L am proud as anything to 248 say And the Egan name for it would be easier to dislodge the Rocky Mountainsthan Dill Egan But the others all the ranchesdown Noon Creek but one all those are a roll call of the gone The Torrance place soldout at a loss the family gone from The Emrich place foreclosed on the family gone from The Chute place sold out at a loss the family gone from Thad Wainwrights place Thad one of the first cattlemen anywhere in this country sold out at a loss Thad passed away within a year The Fain place foreclosed on the family gone from here The Eiseley place soldout at a loss the family gone from The Nansen place Here she paused shook her head a little as if again disavowingAlecs news that this was where he and Leona would set up a household The Nansen place foreclosed on Carl dead by his own band sigrid and the children gone from here to her parents in Minnesota achieving What she a feat L hadnt known could be done Her words the tolling rhythm of soldforeclosedgone from here expressedoutright the fate of those Noon Creek ranching families Yet all the while she was telling an equally strong tale All the ranches down Noon Creekbut one hadbeen her phrase of indictment Everybody in this park this day knew but one could only mean the Double W knewthat each and every of those sales and foreclosures ended up with Wendell Williamson holding the land by outright buy or by lease fromthe First National Bank of Gros Ventre A silent echo I suppose sounds like a contradiction in terms yet L swear this was what ringing inOO the air my mother every soldforeclosedgone from here 249 unspoken fact of that family ranch swallowed by the Double W English Creek she was going on thankfully has been spared the Noon Creek history except once We knew the next of her litany it stared us in the face The English place After Bens death sold to the Wyngard family who werent able to make a go of it against the Depression Foreclosed on the Wyngards gone from here A little bit ago Max Vennaman said this is a day for friends and neighbors and families So it is And so too we must remember these friends and neighbors and families who are not among us today because they were done in by the times This said with a skepticism that suggested the times had familiar human faces behind them But an auction hammer can shatter only a household not the gifts of the earth itself While it may hurt the heart to see such places as the home of Ben English occupied only by time and the wind English Creek is still the bloodstream of our valley It flows its honest way the least little pause here just enough to seed the distinction from those who prosper by the auction hammertvhile we try to find ours She looked up now and out across us all the islands of people Either she had this last part by heart or was making it up as she went because never once did she glance down at her sheaf of pages as she said it There is much wrong with the world and I suppose I am not known to be especially bashful about my list of those things But I think it could not be more right that we honor in this valley a man who 250 savvied the land and its livelihood who honored the earth instead of merely coveting it It could not be more right that tall Ben English in his black hat amid his green fields coaxing a head of water to make itself into nay is the one whose name this creek carries She folded her sheet of papers once then again stuck them in the pocket of her dress and stepped down from the stump Everybody applauded although a few a lot more lukefwarmly than others Under our tree we were all clapping hard and my father hardest of all but I also saw him swallow in a large way And when he realized I was watching him he canted himself in my direction and murmured so that only I could hear That mother of yours Then she was back with us taking compliments briskly Pete studied her and said Decided to give the big boys some particular hell didnt you Even Toussaint told her That was good about the irrigating But of us all it was only to my father that she said in what would have been a demand if there hadnt been the tint of anxiousness in it Well What did you think My father reached and with an extended finger traced back into place a banner of her hair that the creek breeze had lifted and lain across her ear I think he said I think that being married to you is worth all the risk I lead the world in resJ3ct for picnics but I do have to say that ore was enoogh to last ne for a while 251 Toussaint s murmur to me my mothers speech to the universeo A persons thought can kite back and forth between those almost fovever It was just lucky I new had specific matters to put myseJf to fetching Mouse from where he was tethered am ridirg through the dispersing picnickers and headirg on across the English Creek bridge to the rodeo grourrl s I as to meet Ray Heaney on the corral alongside the bucking chutes the best seats in the arena if you didnt mirrl perching on a fence pole Again th is year my fa th er drilled honE to ne his ore point of rodeo protocol 11Just so you stay up on that fence he stipulated I dont want to see you down in there with the chute societyn By which he meant the clump of fifteen or twenty hangerson who always clustered arourrl the gates of too bucking chutes visiting arrl gossiping ard looking generally important am who regularly were cleared out of there two or three tines every rodeo by rampaging broncs When that happered up onto anything climbable they all would scoot to roost like hens ivi th a weasel in their midst and a minute or so after the bronc s passage theyd be right back ill front of the chutes preening anl yakkirg again I suppose the chute society offerrl ed my fathers precept that a horse was nothing to be careless around In any case during the housecleanings when a bronc sent ttem scrambling for the fence it was my fathers habit to cheer loudly for the bronco No Ray yet at our fence So I stayed atop Mouse and watched the world Jn the pens behirrl the chutes the usual kind of beforerodeo confusion was going on guys hassling broncs here and calves there tre air full to capacity vJi th dust and bawling arrl whinnying Out front about haJf the chute society was already planted in place tagends of their conversations mirgliQg That SOB is so tight he wouJrlnt give ten cents to see Christ ride a bicycle backwardsOh hell yes It 11 take a quarter horse over a Morgan horse any time Them Morgans are so damn hotbloodedWi th haying coming arrl one thing and another I dont see hrn Im ever going to catch up with myself11 I saw my mother and father and Pete and Marie and Toussaintand Midge Withrow ffid joined them though Dode wasnt yet in evidencesettling themselves at the far end of the gram stand farthest from the dust the bucking horses would kick up Other people were streamirg by up into the grandstarrl or to sit on car fenders or the ground along the outside of the arena fence I am here to recommend the top of a horse as an advantageous site to view nBnkirrl Everybody below sees mostly the horse not you Definitely I was ready for a recess from attention From trying to judge whether people going by were nudging each other and whispering sideways 11Thats him Thats the ore Got lit up like a ship in a storm o ut there with that Stanley Meixelln Keen as I could be I caught nobody at itat least for sureand began to relax somewhat Oh I did get a couple of looldrg sover Lila Sedge drifted past in her moony ray spied Mouse and lll3 and circled us suspiciously a few times And the priest Father Morrisseau knew re by sight from my stays with the Heaneys and bestowed me a salutation But both those I considered routine inspections so to speak 253 People kept accumulating I kept watching A Gros Ventre rodeo always is slower to get under way than the Second Coming Then I happened to remember Not only was I royally mounted I also was carrying wealth I nudged Mouse into action to go do something about that fourbit piece my father had bestowed Fifty whole cents Maybe the Depression was on the run The journey wasnt far just forty yards or so over to where since Prohibition went home with Hoover the Gros Ventre Rotary Club operated its beer booth I swung down from Mouse and stepped to the plank counter Behind it they had several washtubs full of ice water and bottles of Kessler and Great Falls Select stashed down into the slush until only the brown necks were showing And off to one side a little my interest at the moment the tub of soda pop One of the unresolved questions of my life at that age was whether I liked orange soda or grape soda better It can be more of a dilennna than is generally realized unlike say those picnic options of trout or fried chicken you cant just dive in and have both Anyway I voted grape and was taking my first gulp when somebody inquired at my shoulder Jick hows the world treating you The inquirer was Dode Withrow and his condition answered as to why he wasnt up in the grandstand with Midge and my folks and the others As the expression goes Dode had fallen off the wagon and was still bouncing He was trigged out in a black sateen shirt and nice gray gabardine pants and his dress stockman Stetson so he 254 looked like a million But he also had breath like the downwind side of a brewery Lo Dode You looking for Midge and the folks Theyre down at the far end Dode shook his head as if he had water in his ears That wife of mine isnt exactly looking for me So It was one of the Withrow family jangles that Dode and Midge built up to about once a year During them was the only time Dode seriously drank Tomorrow there was going to be a lot of frost in the air between Midge and Dode then the situation would thaw back to normal It seemed to me a funny way to run a I always wondered what the three Withrow daughters Bea and Marcella and Valerie did with themselves during the annual temper contest between their parents But this summer was showing that I had everything to learn about the ways of man and woman Charlie give me a couple Kesslers Dode was directing across the beer counter Jick you want one Uh no thanks dumbly holding up my grape soda the way a toddler would show off a lollipop That stuffll rot your teeth advised Dode Give you goiter St Vitus dance Did you say two Dode Charlie Hooper called from one of the beer tubs I got two hands dont I While Dode paid and took a swig from one bottle while holding 255 the other in reserve I tried to calculate how far along he was toward being really drunk Always tricky arithmetic About all that could be said for sure was that of all the rodeogoers who were going to get a skin fu11 today at this rate Dode was going to be among the earliest Dode tipped the Kessler down from his mouth and looked straight at JUe Into me it almost seemed And offered Trade you I at first thought he meant his bottle of beer for my grape pop and that befuddled me for plainly Dode was in no mood for pop But no he had something other in mind he still was gazing straight into my eyes What he came out with next clarified his message but did not ease my bafflement My years for yours Jick Ill go back where you are in life you come up where I am Trade straight across No wait Ill toss in Midge to boot He laughed but with no actual humor in it Then shook his head again in that way as if hed just come out from swimming Thats in no way fair Midge is okay Its me he broke that off with a quick swig of Kessler What seemed needed was a change of topic and I asked Where you watching the rodeo from Dode Ray and I are going to grab a fence place up there by the booth whynt you sit with us Many thanks Jick He made it sound as if I had offered him knighthoqd But Im going to hang around the pens a while Want to watch the broncs All Im good for any more Watching And off he swayed beer bottle in each hand as if they were levers he was ing himself by I hated to see Dode in such a mood but at least he 256 always mended quick Tomorrow he would be himself and probably more so again Still no Ray on the fence The Heaneys were taking their sweet time at the family shindig When Ray ever showed up I would have to compare menus in detail with him to see how the Heaneys could possibly outeat what we had gone through at the creek picnic By now my pop had been transferred from its bottle into me and with time still to kill and figuring that as long as I had Mouse I might as well be making use of him I got back up in the saddle I sometimes wonder is the corner of the eye the keenest portion of the body A sort of special sense operating beyond the basic five For the corner of my right eye now registered across the arena and above the filing crowd and top pole of the fence a chokecherrycolored shirt and atop that a head and set of shoulders so erect they could not be mistaken I nudged Mouse into motion and rode around to Alecs side of the rodeo grounds When I got there Alec was off the horse a big alert deepchested blood bay and was fussing with the loop of his lariat in that picky way that calf ropers do All this was taking place out away from the arena fence and the parked cars in some open space which Alec and the bay and the lariat seemed to claim as their own I dismounted too And started things off on an admiring note talking I overheard some there in the pens They were saying how much they admired anybody whod rope them in a shirt like that 257 Jicker he greeted me back What do you know for sure Alecs words were about what they ever would have been yet there hung that tone of absentmindedness behind them again I wanted to write it off to the fact that this brother of mine had calf roping on his mind just then But I couldnt quite convince myself that was all there was to the matter It did occur to me to check whether Alec was wearing a bandanna this year and he wasnt Evidently my father at least had teased that off him permanently Think you got a chance to win I asked just to further the conversation Strictly no problem Alec assured me All the fuss he was giving that rope said something else however How about Bruno Martin He was the young rancher from Augusta who had won the calf roping the previous year I can catch a cold faster than Bruno Martin can a calf Vern Crosby then Another quickasacat roper who I had noticed warming up behind the chute pens What you taking a census or something Alec swooshed his lariat overhead that expectant whir in the air and cast a little practice throw I explored for some topic more congenial to Whered you get the highpowered horse Cal Petrie lent him to me Cal Petrie was foreman of the Double W Evidently Alecs ropeslinging had attracted some attention 258 I lightly laid fingertips to the bays foreshoulder The feel of a horse is one of the best touches I know You missed the creek picnic Mom spoke a speech Alec frowned at his rope Yeah I had to put the sides on Cals pickup and haul this horse in here A speech What about How to sleep with a college book under your pillow and let it run uphill into your ear No About Ben English Ancient history huh Dad must have converted her Alec looked like he intended to say more but didnt There wasnt any logical reason why this should have been on my mind just then but I asked Did you know he had a horse with the same name as himself Who Had a what Ben English Our granddad would say Tank Godt vun of tem vears a Look Jicker I got to walk this horse loose How about you doing me a big hairy favor Something told me to be a little leery Rays going to be waiting for me over on the Only take a couple minutes of your valuable time All it is I want you to go visit Leona for me while I get this horse ready Leona Where is she Down toward the end of the arena there by her folks car As indeed she was when I turned to see About a hundred feet 259 Leona in a clovergreen blouse that gold hair above like daybreak over a lush meadow Yeah well what do you mean by visit Just go on over there and entertain her for me huh Entert Dance a jig tell a joke Alec swung into the saddle atop the bay Easy boss I stepped back a bit and Mouse looked admiring as the bay did a little prance to try Alec out Alec reined him under control and leaned toward me I mean it about you keeping Leona company for me Come get me if Earl Zane shows up I dont want that jughead hanging around her Uh huh Revelation all 22 chapters of it Aw the hell Alec I I was about to declare that I had other things in life to do than fetch him whenever one of Leonas exboyfriends came sniffing around But that declaration melted somewhere before I could get it out for here my way came one of those Leona smiles that would burn down a barn Simultaneously she patted the car fender beside her While I still was molten in the middle of all that Alec touched the bay roping horse into a fast walk toward some open country beyond the calf pens So I figured there was nothing for it but go on over and face fate Lo Leona Hello John Angus Which tangled me right at the start I 260 mean think about it The only possible way in this world she could know about my hightoned name was from Alec Which meant that I had been a topic of conversation between them Which implied didnt know what Damn it all to hell anyway First Toussaint now this I merely was trying to have a standard summer not provide word fodder for the entire damn Two country Yeah well Great day for the race I cracked to recoup Leona smiled yet another of her dazzlers And said nothing Didnt even inquire What race so I could impart The human race and thereby break the ice andYou all by your lonesome I substituted As shrewd as it was desperate this Not only did it fill the air space for a moment I could truthfully tell Alec I had been vigilant about checking on whether or not Earl Zane was hanging around She shook her head Try it sometime while attempting to keep a full smile in place on your face Leona could do it and come out with more smile than she started with When she had accomplished this facial miracle she leaned my way a little and nodded her head conspiratorially toward the other side of the car Holy Jesus Was Earl Zane over there Earl Zane was Alecs size and built as if hed been put together out of railroad ties Alec hadnt defined to me this possibility of Earl Zane already being on hand What was I supposed to do tip my hat to him and merrily say Hi there Earl just stand where you are Ill go get my brother so he can come beat the living daylights out of youn Or better from the 261 standpoint of my own health climb back on Mouse and retreat to my original side of the arena For informations sake I leaned around Leona and peered over the hood of the car And was met by startled stares from Ted and Thelma TracyLeonas parentsand another couple with whom they were seated on a blanket and carrying on a conversation Your folks are looking real good I mumbled as I pulled my head back to normal Nice to see them so Leona though had shifted attention from me to the specimen of horseflesh at the other end of the reins I was holding Riding in style arent you she admired His name is Mouse I confided Though if he was mine Id call him uh Chief Joseph Leona slowly revolved her look from the horse to me the way the beam of a lighthouse makes its sweep Then asked Why not Crazy Horse From Leona that was tiptop humor and I yukked about six times as much as I ordinarily would have And in the meantime was readying myself After all that brother of mine had written the prescription he wanted from me entertain her Boy Ill have to remember that And you know that reminds me of one Did you ever hear the joke about the Chinaman and the Scotchman in a rowboat on the Sea of Galilee Leona shook her head Luck was with me That was my fathers favorite joke one I had heard him tell to other Forest Service guys 262 twenty times the heaviest artillery I could bring to bear Well see there was a Chinaman and a Scotchman together in a rowboat on the Sea of Galilee Fishing away there And after a while the Chinaman puts down his fishing pole and he leans over and nudges the Scotchman and says tell me Is it true what they say about Occidental women And the Scotchman says bccidental hell Im cerrrtain as anything that they behave the way they do on purrrpose I absolutely believed I had done a royal job of telling even burring the s just right But a little crimp of puzzlement now punctuated Leonas smiling face right between her eyes She asked The Sea of Galilee I cast a wide look around for Alec Or even Earl Zane whom I would rather fight with one hand in my pocket than try to explain a joke to somebody who didnt get it Yeah But you see that isnt Just then Mouse got into the act Why he could not have waited another two minutes until I had found a way to dispatch myself from Leona why it didnt come into his horse brain any other time of the day up until that very moment whybut no why about it he was proceeding directly in front of where Leona and I were sharing the fender to take his leak The hose on a horse is no small sight anyway during this process But with Leona there six feet away spectating Mouses seemed to poke down down down I cleared my throat and examined the poles of the arena fence and 263 then the posts that supported the poles and then the sky over the posts and then crossed and uncrossed my arms a few times and still the downpour continued A wild impulse raised in me Mouses lasting whiz reminded me of Dode Withrow spraddled atop that boulder the second day of this unprecedented summer and I clamped my jaw to keep from blurting to Leona that scene and the handhold joke That would be about like you John Angus McCaskill Celebrate disaster with a dose of social suicide Do it up right Meanwhile Leona continued to serenely view the spectacle as if it was the fountains of Rome Ill take over now Jicker Alecs voice came from behind us he had circled outside of the arena on the bay horse Peals of angel song could not have come more welcome How d he do as company Leona Leona shined around at Alec then turned back to bestow me a final glint And answered Hes a wonder I mounted up and cleared out of thereAlec and Leona all too soon would be mooning over each other like I didnt exist anywayand as promptly as I was out of eyeshot behind the catch pen at the far end of the arena I gave Mouse a jab in the ribs that made him woof in surprise Chief Joseph my rosy hind end But I suppose my actual target was life This situation of being old enough to be on the edge of everything and too young to get to the middle of any of it 264 There was this though At least Earl Zane hadnt showed up Is it wolf sbane that the stories say will ward off a werewolf If nothing else maybe I had some sort of future as Zanebane Hi Ray Heaney greeted as I climbed onto the arena fence beside him The grincuts were deep into his face the big front teeth were out on parade Ray could make you feel that your arrival was the central event in his recent life Whatve you been up to summary seemed so far out of the question I chose ity about the usual You Pilot again So saying Ray held up his hands to show his calluses One hard oblong bump across the base of each finger like sets of knuckles on his palms I nodded in commendation My shovel calluses were mosquito bites in comparison This made the second summer Ray was stacking lumber in his fathers lumber yardthe pile it here pile it there nature of that job was what produced the pilot jokeand his hands and forearms were gaining real heft Now Ray thrust his right mitt across to within reach of mine Shake the hand that shook the hand he challenged It was a term we had picked up from his fatherRay could even rumble it just like Ed Heaneys bassdrum voicewho remembered it from his own boyhood in Butte when guys still went around saying Shake the hand that shook the hand of John L Sullivan the heavyweight boxing champ of then I took Ray up on the hand duel even though I pretty well knew how this habitual contest of ours was going to turn out from now on 265 We made a careful fit of the handshake grip then Ray chanted the start One two three After about a minute of mutual grunted squeezing I admitted Okay Im outsquoze I Youll get me next time Ray said Alec riding around acting like a calf roper Some years before Ed Heaney had driven out from Gros Ventre to the ranger station one spring Saturday to talk forest business with my father And with him to my surprise and no little consternation came his son my age Ray I could see perfectly damn well what was intended here and thats the way it did happen Off up the South Fork our fathers rode to eyeball a stand of timber which interested Ed for fence posts he could sell at his lumber yard and Ray and I were left to entertain one another Living out there at English Creek I always was stumped about what of my existence would interest any other boy in the world There was the knoll with the view all the way to the Sweetgrass Hills but somehow I felt that might not hold the fascination for others that it did for me Ordinarily horses would have been on hand to ride one solution to the situation but the day before Isidor Pronovost had taken every one of them in a packstring to a spike camp of CCC tree planters Alec was nowhere in the picture as a possible ally this was haying time and he was driving the scatter rake for Pete Reese The ranger station itself was no refuge the sun was out and my mother would never let us get away with lolling around inside even if I 266 could think up a reasonable loll Matters were not at all improved by the fact that since I still was going to the South Fork grade school and Ray went in Gros Ventre we only knew each other by sight He was a hauriting kid to look at His eyes were within long deepset arcs as if always squinched the way you do to thread a needle And curved over with eyebrows which wouldnt needed to have been much thicker to make a couple of respectable blonde mustaches And then a flattish nose which wide as it was barely accommodated all the freckles assigned to it When Ray really grinned didnt see that this first day although I was to see it thousands of times in the years aheaddeep slicelines cut his cheeks out opposite the corners of his mouth Like a big set of parentheses around the grin His lower lip was so full that it too had a sliceline under it This kid looked more as if hed been carved out of a pumpkin than born Also even more so than a lot of us at that age his front teeth were far ahead of the rest of him in size In any school yard there always were a lot of traded jibes of Beaver tooth but Rays frontals really did seem as if theyd been made for toppling willows As I say haunting I have seen grown men guys who ordinarily wouldnt so much as spend a glance at a boy on the street stop and study that face of Rays And here he was thank you a whole hell of a lot my guest for this day at English Creek So we were afoot with one another and not knowing what to do about it and ended up wandering the creek bank north of the ranger station with boredom building up pretty fast in both of us Finally I got 267 the idea of showing him the pool a little ways downstream in English Creek where brook trout always could be seen hanging there dark in the clear water In fact I asked Ray if he felt like fishing but for some reason he looked at me a little suspiciously and mumbled huh uh We viewed the pool which took no time at all and then thrashed on along in the creek brush for awhile just to be doing anything It was semiswampy going so at least we could concentrate on jumping across the wet holes Ray was dressed in what I suppose his mother thought were old enough clothes to go into the country with but his old clothes were so noticeably ritzier than my everyday ones that he maybe was embarrassed about that Anyway for whatever reason he put up with this brushwhacking venture of mine Whacked was what he got My mind was on something else likely how much of the day still gaped ahead of us and without thinking I let a willow spring back as I pushed past it It whipped Ray across the left side of his face and drew a real yelp from him Also a comment to me Watch out with those beetle brain Didnt mean to I apologized Which most likely would have buried the issue except for what I felt honor bound to add next Sparrow head You wonder afterwards how two reasonably sane people descend into a slanging match like that Slobberguts Ray upped the ante with 268 Booger eater I promptly gave him back Pus gut Turd bird As I remember it I held myself in admirable rein until Ray came out with turkey dink For some reason that one did it I swung on Ray and caught him just in front of the left ear Unluckily not quite hard enough to knock him down He popped me back alongside the neck We each got in a few more swings then the fisticuffs degenerated into a wrestle More accurately a mud wallow We each were strong enough and outraged enough to be able to tip the other so neither one of us ended up permanently on top Simply at some point we wore out on wanting to maul one another any further and got to our feet Rays clothes looked as if hed been rolled the length of a pig pen Mine I guess werent much better but they hadnt started off as fancy and so I figured my muss didnt matter as much Of course try convince my mother of that Come noon we had to straggle in to get any dinner and when she laid eyes on us we were in for a scouring in more ways than one Ray she made change into a set of my clothesfunny how improved he looked when he was out of that town gearand sat us at opposite ends of the table while we ate then immediately afterward she issued two decrees Jick I believe you would like To Read in the Other Room Ray I think you would like To Put Together the Jigsaw Puzzle I Am Going to Put Here on the Table 269 for You When I started high school in Gros Ventre Ray came over to me at noo our the first day He planted himself just out of arms reach from me and offered Horse apple I balled up both my fists and my tongue got ready the words which would fan our creekside battle to life again Beaver tooth Yet the direction of Rays remark caught my notice Horse apple was pretty far back down the scale from turkey link For once in my life I latched on to a possibility I held my stance and tendered back to Ray Mud minnow It started a grin on him while he thought up Slough rat Gumbo gopher I provided barely managing to get it out before we were both laughing Within the week I was asking my mother whether I could stay in town overnight with Ray and after that I made many a stayover at the Heaneys throughout the school year Not only did I gain the value of Ray and me being the best of friends it was always interesting to me that the Heaneys were a family as different from ours as crochet from oil cloth For one thing they were Catholic although they really didnt display it all that much Just through a grace before every arrl saint here and there on the wall am fish on Friday which eventually occurred to me as the reason Ray had looked at me suspiciously there at the creek when I asked him about fishing For another in almost every imaginable way too Heaney family was as tidy as spa ts on a rooster The n almost was this Ray ard his sister Mary Ellen three years younger were allrned 270 liberties with thair food thlt Id never dreamt of Take hotcakes as an example Ray am Mary Ellen poured sorre syrup on then rolled each hotcake up then syrured the outside and began eating A ldnd of maple syrup tarrale I now knew enough to realize When I first began overnighting with them they urged rre to try mine that way but the thought of my mothers response to sorre thing like that made me figure I might as well not get converted At other m als too Ray and Mary Ellen squooged their focrl around in remarla ble ways arrl ate only as much of it as they felt like I tell ycu it shocked rre people my am age leavLrg plates that looked more as if theyd been walked through than eaten from Rays mother Genevieve kept that big twostory thee house dusted and doilied to a fare well Mary Ellen already had her mirrl set on being a nurses he was a kind of starchy kid anyway so it probably was a good enough ideaaYJi you couldnt scratch a firiger around there without her wanting to daub it with Mercurochrotre arrl wrap you up like a mwmny Toon there was Rays father Ed You could hang your hat on Ed Heaneys habits Every evenirg he clicked the lock on the door of the lumber yard office as if it was the final stroke needed to complete six oclock and if he wasnt walldrg in the ldtchen door at five minutes after six Genevieve started peering out the kitchen window to see what had happened to him Another five minutes Ed washing up and toweling dcwn and supper began As soon as supper as over Ed sat at the kitchen table going through the Falls Leader and visiting with Genevieve while she did the dishes his deep voice and her twinkly one back and forth back and fortho Then at seven 271 straight up Ed strode into tha livil room planted himself in his rocking chair and clicked on the big Philco floor radio He listened straight through until Abyssinian had come on the air Ed would have sat there and and then went up to bed Thus everything in the Heaney household in the was done against the backdrop of Eds Philco aro Genevieve arrl Ray arrl Mary Ellen had be cone s 0 used to tuning OU t sou ro that you often had to say sonething w them a couple of tim3s to make it register In Ray there was an opposite kin1 of consequence too Ray had heard so much radio he could mimic just about any of it Eddie Cantor and Walter Winchell and Kaltenborn the news and all those But Ed I was tellill about You couldnt know it to look at Ed Heamythe lurrb eryard life had put a middle on him and he was bald as a jugbut he served in France during the war In fact spent I dont know how much tina in the trenches Enough that he didnt want 00 squander one further minute of bis life talkil about it evidently Just once did I ever manage 00 get him going on that topic That Ed won soITE nedals over there I knew because Ray once sneaked them out of a dresser drawer in Ed and Genevieves bedroom and showed them to me You wouldnt expect medalwinnirg about Ed either In any case though ore Heare y s uppertine when I was in to stay wi th Ray some topic cane up that emboldened ne to outright ask Ed what he remembered mes t about being in the war Figuring of course I might hear tales that led to the nedals 272 Shaving After a while Ed glanced up from his eatirg and realized that Ray and Mary Ellen and Genevieve and I were all him in a stymied way nwe had to shave every day 11 he elaborated Wherever we were Belleau Wood we only got a canteen of water per man per day But we still used some of it to shave The gas masks they gave us were a F rench kind Sort of a sack that went over your face like Ed ran a harrl around his chinline If you had whiskers it didnt fit tight enough Gas would get in Youd be a goner Ed began to take another bite of his supper but instead repeated Belleau Wood About midday there we1d be in our graves we called themall of us shaving or holdiq our shirts up to read them for lice Thousarrls of us all doing ore or the other11 The other four of us waited dumbstruck to see where this sudden hallway of Eds rrem ory led But all he said more was Pass the strirgbeans please 0 2D Now that we were established atop the arena corral I reported to Ray my chin session with Dode Withrow at the beer booth Ray took what might be called a spectator interest in the Withrow family He never came right out and said so but his eye was on the middle Withrow girl Marcella who was in the same high school class we were Marcella was trim in figure like Midge and had a worldbythetail grin like Dodes usual one So far Rays approach to Marcella was distant admiration but I had the feeling he was trying to figure out how to narrow the distance Maybe the day would come when I was more interested in a Leona or a Marcella than in perching up there above general humanity but right then I doubted it I considered that the toppole perch Ray and I had there next to the bucking chutes was the prime site of the whole rodeo grounds We had clear view of every inch of the arena the dirt oval like a small dry lake bed before us And all the event action would originate right beside us where even now the broncs for the first section of bareback riding were being hazed into the chutes alongside my corral spot The particular Gros Ventre bucking chute setup was that as six broncs at a time were hazed in for their set of riders pole panels were retracted between each chute leaving what had been the halfdozen chutes as one long narrow pen Then as the horses crowded in in single file the panels were shoved in place behind them one by one penning each bronc into the chute it would buck into the arena from As slick a system as there is for handling rodeo broncs I suppose But what is memorable to me about it is the instant before 274 the pole panels were shoved into place to serve as chute dividers when the horses came swarming into the open chute pen flanks heaving heads up and eyes glittering From my perch it was like looking down through a transom into a long hallway suddenly filled with big perplexed animals Not many sights are its equql Above and to the left of Ray and me was the announcing booth and its inhabitants a nice proximity which added to the feeling that we were part of the inside happenings of the rodeo To look at the booth resembled a little woodshed up on stilts situated there above and just in back of the middle of the bucking chutes It held elbow room for maybe six people although only three of the booth crowd did any actual rodeo work Tallie Zane if you could call his announcing work Tollie evidently was in residence at the far end of the booth angled out of view from us but a large round microphone like a waffle iron standing on end indicated his site Then nearest to us was the scorekeeper Bill Reinking editor of the Gleaner prominent with his ginger mustache and silverwire eyeglasses I suppose he did the scorekeeping on the principle that the only sure way for the Gleaner to get any accuracy on the rodeo results was for him to originate the arithmetic Between Bill and Tollie was the space for the timekeeper who ran the stopwatch to timetheevents and blew the whistle to signal when a bronc rider had lasted eight seconds atop a bareback or ten in a saddle ride The timekeepers spot in the booth was empty but this was about to be Wup wup wup some Paul Revere among the chute society cried Here 275 she comes boys Just starting up the ladder Heads swiveled like weathervanes hit by a tornado And yes Ray and I also sent our eyes around to the little ladder along the side of the announcing booth and the hypnotizing progress up it of Velma Simms Tighter than last year I swear to God someone below us was contending cf Like the paper fits the wall testified And yet another But I still need to know how the hell does she get herself into those britchesf1Velma Simms came of eastern money plumbing equipment I believe was its source I have seen her family name Croake on hotandcold spigots And in a community and era which considered divorce usually more grievous than manslaughter she had been through three husbands That we knew of Only the first was local the lawyer Paul Bogan They met in Helena when he got himself elected to the legislature and if my count is right it was at the end of his second term when Velma arrived back to Gros Ventre and Paul stayed over there at the capital in some kind of state job Her next husband was a fellow named Sutter whod had an automobile agency in Spokane In Gros ventre he was like a trout out of water and quickly went After him came Simms an actor Velma happened across in some summer performance at one of the Glacier Park lodges By February of his first Two country winter Simms was hightailing his way to California although he eventually did show up back in Gros Ventre so to speak as one of the cattle rustlers in a Gene Autry movie at the Odeon Lately Velma seemed to have given up marrying and instead emerged each Fourth with the current beauthey tended to be like the scissorbill following her up the ladder now in a 276 gabardine stockmans suit and a too clean cream Stetson probably a bank officer from Great Fallsin tow I cite all this because Paul Bogan the first in the genealogy always had served as rodeo timekeeper and the next Fourth of July after his change of residence here Velma presented herself bold as new paint to take up his stopwatch and whistle It was her only instance of what might be called civic participation and quite why she did it nobody had a clue But Velmas ascension to the booth now was part of every Gros Ventre rodeo Particularly for the male portion of the audience For as you may have gathered Velmas Fourth appearances were encased in annual new slacks of stunning snugness One of the theoreticians in the chute society just now was postulating a fresh concept that maybe Velma heated them with an iron put them on hot and let them shrink down on her like the rim onto a wagon wheel I saw once in recent years at the Gros Ventre rodeo a young bronc rider and his ladyfriend watching the action through the pole arena gate They each held a can of beer in one hand and the riders other hand was around the girls shoulders Her other hand though was down resting lightly on his rump the tips of her fingers just touching the inseam of his Levis back there Ill admit to you it made my heart turn around and face north That the women now can and will do such a thing seems to me an advance like radio My awe of it is tempered only by the regret that I am not that young man or any other But let that go My point here is just that in the earlier time only rare advertised rumps such as that of Velma Simms were targets of public 277 interest and then only by what my father and the other rangers called ocular examination It registered on me there had been a comment from Rays direction Come again I apologized No hitch in Velmas gitalong Ray offered one more time I said something equally bright in agreement but I was surprised at Ray making an open evaluation of Velma Simms even so tame a one as that The matter of Marcella maybe was on his mind more than I figured Just then an ungodly noise somewhere between a howl and a yowl issued above us A sort of high HHHRUNGHHH like a cat was being skinned alive I was startled as hell but Ray knew its source You see Tallies loudspeaking getup he inquired with a nod toward the top of the announcers booth I couldnt help but have noticed such a rig The contraption was a pyramid of rods which held at its peak a halfdozen big metal cones like those morningglory horns on old graphs pointing to various points of the compass Just in case those didnt cover the territory there was a second set of four more glory horns a couple of feet beneath He sent off to Billings for it informed Ray who had overheard this information when Tallie came to the lumber yard for a number of 2 X 4s to help brace the contraption into place The guy who makes them down there told him its the real deal to announce with We were not the only ones contemplating Tallies new announcing machinery What the goddamn hells Tallie going to do I heard somebody say below us tell them all about it in Choteau Choteau 278 was 33 miles down the highway WELCOME crackled a thunderblast of voice over our heads To the show with us is liable Gros Ventre rodeo You folks are wise here today Yes to happen here Our fifteenth as hooty owls sir Some of annual to roost everything today and Tallie Zane father of the famous Earl held the job of announcing the Gros Ventre rodeo on the basis by which a lot of positions of authority seem to get filled nobody else would be caught dead doing it But before this year all that the announcing amounted to was shouting through a megaphone the name of each bucking horse and its rider The shiny new glory horns evidently had gone to Tallies head or at least his tonsils The Fourth of July is called the cowboys Christmas underway and our in just festivities here today will get Called what somebody yelled from the chute society Thats Tallie for you sweat running down his face and he thinks its flakes Santy Claus must have brought him that goddamn talking contraption guessed somebody else Naw you guys lay off now a third one put in Tallies maybe right Itd explain why hes as full of shit as a Christmas goose Everybody below us heeheeed at that while Tallie roared on about the splendiferous tradition of rodeo and what heartstopping excitement we were going to view in this arena today Tallie was a kind of plodding 279 talker anyway and now with him slowed down either out of respect for the new sound system or because he was translating his remarks from paperthis July stuff was originating from somewhere had a kit come with the glory horns and microphoneyou could about boil an egg between parts of his sentences Anybody here from Great Falls Quite a number of people yelled and waved their hands Welcome to America Out in the crowd there were laughs and groans And most likely some flinching in the Rotary beer booth a real boon to business Tallie cracking wise at the expense of people whod had 90 miles of driving time to wonder whether this rodeo was worth coming to But this seemed to be a day when Tallie armed with amplification was ready to take on the world How about North Dakota Whos here from North Dakota Of course no response Tourists were a lot scarcer in those days and the chances that anybody would venture from North Dakota just to see the Gros Ventre rodeo were zero and none Thats right blared Tallie If I was you I wouldnt admit it neither Tallie spieled on for awhile actually drawing boos from the Choteau folks in the crowd when he proclaimed that Choteau was known as a town without a single bedbug No sir they are all married and have big families At last though the handling crew was through messing with the broncs in the chutes alongside Ray and me tf 280 and Tallie was declaring We are just about to get the pumpkin rolling Bareback riding will be our first event Pumpkin questioned whoever it was in the chute society that was keeping tab of Tallies excursions through the calendar Judy H Christ Now the whistledick thinks its Halloween About all that is worth mentioning of the early part of that rodeo is that its events a section of bareback riding and after that some steer wrestling or mauling or whatever you want to call it passed fairly mercifully Ray and I continued to divide our time snorting laugrjs over something either Tallie or the chute society provided Plus our own wisefacre efforts of course Ray nearly fell off the corral from cackling when I speculated whether this much time sitting on a fence pole mightnt leave a person with the crack in his behind running crosswise instead of up and down You know how that is humor is totally contagious when two persons are in the same light mood And a good thing too for by my estimation the actual events of a rodeo can always use all the help they can get Although like anybody out here I have seen many and many a rodeo to me the arena events are never anything to write home special about Its true that bareback riding has its interesting moments but basically the ride is over and done with about as its getting started I dont know a guy flopping around on the naked back of a horse just seems to me more of a stunt than a sport As for steer wrestling that is an absolutely phony deal never done except there in front of a rodeo crowd Leaping onto a running steer has about as much to do with actual cattle ranching as wearing turquoise belt buckles does And that calf roping Calf roping I nominate as an event the spectators ought to yayhoo be paid for sitting through I mean herell come one after the calf swinging a community loop an elephant could trot through and the next guy will pitch a loop so teeny that it bounces off the back of the calfs neck like a spitwad Whiff whiff whiff and then a burst of cussing as the ropeflingers throw misses its mark there is the essence of rodeo calf roping If I ran the world thered be standards such as making any calf roping entrant dab onto a fencepost twenty feet away just to prove he knows how to build a decent loop Anyway All I am saying in this rodeo sermon is that the best feature of the whole affair to meexcept maybe for the processional of a Velma Simmsis the excuse it gives everyone to gather together for most of an afternoon Present me several hundred people to gawk around at and speculate on and yes somehow be part of and that is my idea of the highest sort of holiday If various forms of nonsense with livestock have to be put up with for that so be it Alecs bringing his horse in Ray reported from his sphere of the arena Guess hes roping in this section Sos everybody else in the world it looks like Horsemen and hemp hemp and horsemen It was a wonder the combined swishing of the ropes of all the wouldbe calf ropers now assembling didnt lift the rodeo arena off the ground like an autogyro As you maybe can tell my emotions about having a brother forthcoming into this event 282 were strictly mixed Naturally I was pulling for Alec to win Brotherly blood is at least that thick Yet a corner of me was shadowed with doubt as to whether victory was really such a good idea for Alec Did he need any more confirming in his cowboy mode Especially in this dubious talent of hanging rope necklaces onto slobbering calves This first section of the calf roping now proceeded about as I could have foretold a lot of air fanned with rope but damn few calves collared One surprise was produced though f ter a st catch Bruno Martin of Augusta missed his tie the calf kicking free before its required six seconds flat on the ground were up If words could be seen in the air some blue dandies accompanied Martin out of the arena The other strong roper Vern Crosby snagged his calf neatly suffered a little trouble throwing him down for the tie but then niftily gathered the calfs legs and wrapped the pigging string around them as Tallie spelled out for us faster than Houdini can tie his shoe laces blood So when the moment came for Alec to guide roping horse into the breakout area beside the calf chute the situation was as evident as Tallies voice bleating from that tin bouquet of glory horns Nineteen seconds by Vern Crosby is still the time to beat Itll take some fancy twirling by this next young buckaroo One of the hands out at the Double will be w ready 283 hes gett1ng in just his self squared away and The calf chute and the breakout area where each roper and his horse burst out after the creature were at the far end of the bucking chutes from Ray cupped his hands and called across to there Wrap him up pretty Alec AcrosB there Alec appeared a little nervous dandling his rope around more than was necessary as he and the bay horse waited for their calf to emerge Butthen L discovered I was halfnervous myself jiggling my foot on its corral pole and I had no excuse whatsoever You wouldnt catchme out there trying to snare a 75pound animal running full tiit The starters little red flag whipped down and the calf catapulted fromthe chute into the expanse of the arena Alecs luck Sometimes you had to think he held the patent on fourleaf clovers and rabbits feet The calf he drew was a straight runner instead of a dodger Up the middle of the arena that calf gallopedas if he was on rails the big horse gaining ground on him for Alec every hoofbeat And I believe that if you could have pulled the truth from my father and mother right then even they would have said that Alec looked the way a calf roper ought to Leaning forward but still as firm in his stirrups as if socketed into them swinging the loop of the lariat around and around his head strongly enough to give it a good fling but not overdoing it Evidently there had been much practice performed on Double W calves as Alec rode the coulees 2i these past weeks Dab it on him I heard loudly and realized the yell had been by me Quicker than it can be told Alec made his catch A good one where all the significant actions erupt together the rope ing into a tan line in the air the calf gargling out a bleahh as the loop choked its neck and yanked it backward Alec evacuating from the stirrups in his dismount Within a blink he was in front of the tall bay horse and scampering beside the stripe of rope the bay was holding taut as f ishline and now Alec was upending the calf into the arena dust and now gathering calf legs and now whipping the pigging string around them and now done The time for Alec McCaskill n I thought I could hear remorse inside the tinny blare of Tallies voice and so knew the report was going to be good seventeen The crowd whooped and clapped and a half seconds Over at the far fence Leona was beaming as if she might ignite and down at the end of the grandstand my parents were glumly accepting congratulations on Alec Beside me Ray was as surprised as I was by Alecs firstrate showing and his delight didnt have the conditions attached that mine did How much is up he wondered I wasnt sure of the roping prize myself so I asked the question to the booth and Bill Reinking leaned out and informed ushirty dollars and supper for two at the Sedgwick House Pretty slick Ray admired I had to think so myself Performance is performance whatever my opinion of Alecs venue of it Later in the 285 afternoon there would be one more section of calf ropers but with the main guys Bruno Martin and Vern Crosby already behind him Alecs leading time looked good enough to take to the bank Tallie was bleating onward Now we turn to some prairie sailors and the hurricane deck which translated to the first goround of saddle bronc riding I will say for saddle bronc riding that it seems to me the one rodeo event that comes close to legitimate Staying on a mount that is trying to unstay you is a historic procedure of the livestock business The boys are hazing the ponies into and when we commence and get started the chutes the first man out will be Bill Semmler meanwhile on a horse though did fellow who goes into called you hear the barber Conniption In this the one shop about and the I never did get to hear Tallies tonsorial tale for I happened to glance down to my left into the bucking chutes and see disaster in a spotted horsehide charging full tilt at me Hang on I yelled to Ray and simultaneously flipflopped myself rightward and dropped down the fence so that I had my arms clamped around hath the top corral pole and Rays hips Ray glommed tight to the pole with his hands WHOMP and a clatter The impact of the pinto bucking horse slamming into the chuteend where our section of corral cornered into it went shuddering through the pair of us as if a giant sledgehammer had hit the wood but our double gripping kept us from being flung off the top of the fence 286 Jesus Ray let out rare for him Theres a goosy one Our narrow brush did not escape microphone treatment This little couple of Coffee Nerves fence squatters pinto down at hugging Tallie was alerting the world Well see go ahead and kiss it chute six has a the wood whether pretty good they Numbnuts I muttered in the direction of the Zane end of the announcing booth Or possibly more than muttered for when I managed to glower directly up there Bill Reinking was delivering me a fying wink and Velma Simms was puckered the way a person does to hold in a laugh Ray had it right the pinto was truly riled and then some as I could confirm while cautiously climbing back onto my perch and locking a firm arm around the corner post between chute and corral No way was I going to take a chance on being dislodged down into the company of this Coffee Nerves bronc The drawback of this floodthechuteswithhorses system was that the first horse in was the last to come out from this end chute next to me While the initial five horses were being bucked out Coffee Nerves was going to be cayusing around in chute six and trying to raise general hell The pinto looked more than capable Coffee Nerves had closeset pointy ears what are called pin ears and indicate orneriness in a horse Worse he was hogeyed Had small darty eyes that shot looks at the nearest threat all the time Which given my position on the fence happened to be me I had not been the target of so much eyeball 287 since the tussle to get that Bubbles packhorse up the side of the mountain One thing I have skipped in life is any desire toward rodeo riding With no least regret Maybe that makes me less a westerner than I ought to be But it also has made me a less ramshackle human being Letting a horse scramble your brains and wallop your bones and joints for the fun of it is not my idea of intelligent living Particularly if the bronc is on the order of Coffee Nerves touchy anyway and now in a real shitf it of fury about being caged in a chute Ray was peering behind me to study Coffee Nerves so he was the one who noticed Huh Look who mustve drew him There in back of chute six Earl Zane was helping the handlers try to saddle the pinto My session of watchdogging Leona for Alec of course whetted my interest in the matter of Earl Zane whom I ordinarily wouldnt bat an eye to look at Now here he loomed not ten feet away from Ray and me at the rear of Coffee Nerves chute amid the cussing crew of handlers trying to contend with the pinto and the saddle that was theoretically supposed to go on its back Earl Zane had one of those faces that could be read at a glance as clear as the label on a maple sugar jug it proclaimed SAP I suppose he was semigoodlooking in a sulky kind of way But my belief was that Earl Zanes one known ability handling horses derived from the fact that he possessed the identical amount of brain as the average horse did and they thus felt affinity with him Though whether Coffee Nerves who was whanging a series of kicks to the chute lumber that I could feel arrive up through the corral pole I 288 was seated on was going to simmer down enough to accommodate Earl Zane or anybody else remained an open question In any case I was transfixed by what was brewing here Alec looked likely to win the calf roping Coffee Nerves gave every sign of being the buckingest saddle bronc if Earl could stay on him Two winners one Leona The arithmetic of that was something to contemplate Various geezers of the chute society were peering in at Coffee Nerves and chiming Whoa hoss and Here now knot head settle down J which was doing nothing to improve the pintos disposition After all would it yours Distracted by the geezer antics and the EarlAlec equation I didnt notice the next arrival until Ray pointed out Second one of the litter Indeed Earl Zane had been joined in the volunteer saddling crew by his brother Arlee the one a year ahead of Ray and me in school Another horse fancier with brain to match And full to overflowing with the Zane family swagger for Arlee Zane was a big pink specimen about what youd get if you could coax a hog to strut around on its hind egs wearing blue jeans and a rodeo shirt Eventually maybe Arlee would duplicate Earl brawny instead of overstuffed But at present there just was too much of all of him up to and including his mouth At the moment for instance Arlee had strutted around to the far side of the announcing booth and was yelping up to his sire Tell them to count out the prize money Old Earl is going to set his horse on fire God those Zanes did think they were the dingdong of the worlds bell 289 How about a bottle of something I proposed to Ray The mental strain of being Zanebane must have been making me thirsty Im big rich Ill buy Ace high thought this sounded and added that hed hold our seats Down I climbed and away to the beer booth again The tubs werent showing many Kessler and Select necks by now I halfexpected to coincide with Dode again but didnt But by the time I returned to Ray with our two bottles of grape I was able to more or less offhandedly report that I had seen Marcella and the other Withrow daughters in the shade under the grandstand with a bunch more of the girls we went to school with Leona on one side of the arena Marcella and the school multitude on the other Velma Simms in the air behind us I did have to admit lately the world was more full of females than I had ever previously noticed Under way again Tallie was issuing forth A local buckaroo corning out of chute number oneBill Semmler made his ride but to not much total his bronc a straight bucker who crowhopped down the middle of the arena in no were particularly inspired way until the ten and the whistle blew Exercise commented Ray meaning that was all Semmler was going to get out of such a rocking horse ride At that though exercise was more than what was produced by the next rider an outoftown guy whose name I didnt recognize Wouldbe rider I ought to say for a horse called Harn What Arn sailed him onto 290 the earth almost before the pair of them issued all the way out the gate of chute two Ham What Am then continued his circuit of the arena kicking dirt twenty feet into the air with every buck while the ostensible rider knelt and tried to get any breath back into himself Lets give this hardluck cowboy a big hand Tallie aaAfated He sure split a 1 k h ong crac in t e air that time You guys see any crack out there in the air somebody below us inquired Where the hell is Tallie getting that stuff Monkey Ward it was suggested From the same page featuring toilet paper But then one of the Rides Proud brothers from up at Browningone or another of Toussaints army of grandnephews he wasnt on speaking terms withlived up to his name and made a nice point total atop a chunky roan called Snuffy Sunfishing was Snuffys tactic squirming his hind quarters to one side and then the other with each jump and if the rider manages to stay in tune with all that hula wiggling it yields a pretty ride This performance was plenty good enough to win the event unless Earl Zane could do something wonderful on top of Coffee Nerves Following the Rides Proud achievement the crowd laughed as they did each year when a little buckskin mare with a flossy mane was announced as Shirley Temple and laughed further when the mare piled the contestant guy from Shelby with its third jump That Shirley for a little gal shes got a mind 291 of her own bayed Tallie evidently under the impression he was providing high humor Then sooner than it seemed possible for him to have drawn sufficient breath for it he was giving us the next loudspeaker dose Now here is a rider I have some acquaintance with Getting set in chute number five on Dust Storm Earl Zane Show them how Earl So much for assuming the obvious Earl had not drawn the pinto his and Arlees participation in saddling it was only the Zane trait of sticking a nose into anything available The fact remained though that Alecs rival was about to bounce out into the arena aboard a bucking animal I craned my neck trying to get a look at Leona but she was turned in earnest conversation with a certain calf roper wearing a chokecherry shirt and I could only see golden a golt floss Quite a wash of disappointment went through me Somehow I felt I was missing the most interesting scene of the entire rodeo Leonas face just then And here he comes a cowboying sonof agun and a son of yours trulyII In fairness I will say Earl Zane got a bad exit from the chute the cinnamoncolored bronc he was on taking a little hop into the arena and stopping to gaze around at the world just as Earl was all primed for him to buck Then as it sank in on Earl that the horse wasnt bucking and he altered the rhythm of his spurring to fit that situation Dust Storm began to whirl A spin to the left Then one to the right It was worth the admission to see Earls thought process 292 clanking one direction and the horses the other then each reversing and passing one another in the opposite direction like two drunks trying to find each other in a revolving door The cinnamon bronc though was always one phase ahead of Earl and his third whirl which included a sort of sideways dip caused Earl to lurch and lose the opposite stirrup It was all over then merely a matter of how promptly Earl would keep his appointment with the arena dirt Blew a stirrup came from the chute society as Earl picked himself up off the planet and the whistle was heard Oughtve filled those stirrups with chewing gum before he climbed on that merrygoround Tollie however considered that we had seen a shining feat Almost You can made it still show to the whistle on that your face around home rough one Earl Possibly the pintos general irritation with the world rather than the diet of Tollies voice produced it but either way Coffee Nerves now went into his biggest eruption yet Below me in the chute he began to writhe and kick whinnying awfully and I redoubled my life grip on the corner post as the thunk thunk of his hooves tattooing the wood of the chute reverberated through the seat of my pants Careful Ray warned and I suppose sense would have been to trade my perch for a more distant site Yet how often does a person get to see at close range a horse in combat with mankind Not just see but feel in the continuing tulks and hear the pintos whinny 293 a sawblade of sound ripping the air and smell sweat and manure and animal anger in one mingled unforgettable odor Coffee Nerves hammerwork with his hooves built up to a crash a splay of splintJrs which sent the handlers tumbling away from the back of the chute and then comparative silence just the velocity of air through the pinto broncs nostrils The sonofabitch is hung up somebody reported In truth Coffee Nerves was standing with his rear right leg up behind him the way a horse does for a blacksmith to shoe him Except that instead of any human having hold of that wicked rear hoof it was jammed between a solid chute pole and the splintered one above it As the handling crew gingerly moved in to see what could be done about extrication Tallie enlightened the crowd This little pinto pony down in six is still proving kind of recaltrisant The chute boys are doing some persuading and our show will resume in just a jifty In the meantime since this is the cowboys Christmas so to say that reminds me of a little story Jesus hes back onto Christmas issued from the chute society Will somebody go get Tallie a goddam calendar Dumb as he is it was pointed out itll take two of us to read it to him There was this little boy who wanted a pony for Christmas Somebody had gone for a prybar to loosen the imprisoning poles and free the renegade pony of chute six but in the meantime there was nothing to do but let Tallie wax forth Even at normal Tallies voice sounded as if his adenoids had gotten twined with his vocal cords With the boost from the address system his steady drone now was a real earcleaner Well you see this little boy kept telling the other kids in the family that he had it all fixed up with Santa Claus Santa Claus was going to bring him a pony certain sure So when Christmas Eve came they all of them hung their stockings by the fireplace there If I hang up a woolsack alongside my stove somebody in front of the chutes pined suppose Id get Velma Simms in it And the other kids thought theyd teach this little boy a lesson So after everybody had gone to bed they got back up again and went on out to the barn and got some ladies excuse my language horse manure Quick mark that down somebody advised up to Bill Reinking Thats the first time Tallies ever apologized for spouting horse shit and filled his stocking with it So the next morning theyre all gathered to look and see what Santa Claus lefteach one of them Little Susie says Look he leftme a dollie here in MY stocking And little Tommy says And look he left me apples and oranges in MINE And they turned to the little boy and asked Well Johnny what 295 did Santa leave YOU And Johnny looked in his stocking and said He left me my pony but he got away There was that sickly laughter a crowd gives out because its embarrassed not t0 and then one of the chute men called up to the booth that they had the goddamn bronc freed get the rider on him before he raised any more hell BACK TO BUSINESS Tollie blared as if he was calling elephants before Bill Reinking managed to lean across and shove the microphone a little farther from Tallies mouth to business The bronc in chute six has consented to rejoin us Next man up last one in this goround on a horse called Coffee Nerves will be Dode Withrow I yanked my head around to see for sure Yes Dode was up top the back of chute six gazing at the specimen of exasperated horse below Dode did look a little soberer than when I met up with him by the beer booth He wasnt any bargain of temperance yet though His face looked hot and his Stetson sat toward the back of his head in a dude way I had never seen him wear it Ray was saying I never knew Dode to enter the bucking before Which coincided with what was going through my mind that Dode was the age of my father and Rays That his bronc stomping had taken place long years ago That I knew for a certainty Dode did not even break horses for his own use any more but bought them saddle ready from Tallie Zane No I answered Ray not in our time 296 I had a clear view down into the chute as the bronc crew tried to keep Coffee Nerves settled long enough for Dode to ease into the saddle The pinto went through another symphony of commotion kicking and slamming and whinnying that sawtoothed sound but then hunched up motionless for a moment in a kind of sitting squat eoiaeatl contemplating what next to pull from its repertoire In that moment Dode simply said Good enough and slid into the saddle As if those words of Dodes were a curfew the gapers and gawkers of the chute society evaporated from the vicinity where Coffee Nerves would emerge into the arena some of them even seeking a safe nest up on the corrql One of a bad one in little pinto our friends and his time Hell be in just one neighbors dancing out minute Dode is Rode many on this Tt honestly occurred no more than a handful of seconds from then Dode had the grip he wanted on the bucking rope and his arm was in the air as if ready to wave and he said in that same simple tone Open The gate swung and Coffee Nerves vaulted into the arena I saw Dode suck in a fast breath then heard it go out of him in a huhhh as the horse lit stifflegged with its forefeet and kicked the sky with its hind from both directions ramming the surprise of its force up through the stirrups into Dode Dodes hat left him and bounced once on the pinto splotch across Coffee Nerves rump and then toppled into the dust of the arena But Dode himself didnt shake loose at all which was a fortunate thing because Coffee Nerves 297 already was uncorking another maneuver this time swapping ends before crashing down in all stifflegged style Dode still sat deep in the saddle although another huhhh reamed its way out of him Maybe imagine you have just jumped from a porch roof to the ground twice in about five seconds to give yourself some idea of the impact Dode was absorbing He must have been getting Coffee Nerves respect for now the bronc exactly reversed the endswapping he had just done a trick almost guaranteed to catch the rider leaning wrong Yet Dode still was up there astride the pinto I remember tasting dust My mouth was open to call encouragement to Dode but there was nothing that seemed good enough to call out for this ride he was making Now Coffee Nerves launched into the jump he had been saving up for a real cloudchaser Dode at the same instant raking the horses ders with his spurs both those actions fitting together exactly as if animal and man were in rhythm to a signal none of the rest of us could hear up and up the horse twisting into the air and the riders free left arm high above that Coffee Nerves and Dode soaring together while the crowds urging cry seemed to help hold them there a wave of sound suspending the pair above the arena earth so that we all could have time to fix the sight into memory everlastingly Somewhere amid it all the whistle blew That is off some far wall of my awareness echoed that news of Dode having ridden Coffee Nerves but the din that followed flooded over it I still believe that if Coffee Nerves had lit straight as any sane horse would do descending 298 from a moon visit like that Dode would not have blown that left But somehow Coffee Nerves skewed himself halfsideways about the time he hit the ground imagine now that the ground yanks itself to one side as you plummet off that porch and Dode who evidently did not hear the timers whistle or was ignoring it stayed firm in the right stirrup nicely braced as he was but the pintos slewfoot maneuver jolted his boot from the left one And now when Coffee Nerves writhed into his next buck cattywampus to the left he simply sailed away from under Dode who dropped off him backfirst falling like a man given a surprise shove into a creek Not water however but dust flew up around the form which thumped to the arena surface The next developments smudged together I do know that now I was shouting out Dode Dode and that I lit running in the arena direct from the top of the corral never even resorted to any of the poles as rungs to get down and that Ray landed right behind me As to what we thought we were going to accomplish I am even less clear simply could not see Dode sprawled out there by himself I suppose The pickup man Dill Egan was spurring his horse between Dode and Coffee Nerves and having to swat the pinto in the face with his hat to keep him off Dode Before it seemed possible my father and Pete were out there too and a half dozen other men from out of the grandstand and Alec and a couple of others from the far side of the arena their hats thwacking at Coffee Nerves as well and through all the commotion I could hear my fathers particular roar of HYAH HYAH again and again before the bronc finally veered off 299 fell off the rainbow on that one right enough Tallie was blaring So that registered on me and the point that the chute society this once when they could have been useful out here in the arena were dangling from various fence perches or peering from behind the calf chute But the sprint Ray and I made through the loose arena dirt is marked in me only by the sound that reached us just as we reached Dode The noise hit our ears from the far end of the arena a tingling crack like a tree breaking off and then crashing and thudding as it came down For a confused instant I truly thought a cottonwood had fallen My mind tried to put together that with all else happening in this overcrowded space of time But no Coffee Nerves had slammed headon into the gate of the catch pen toppling not just the gate but the hefty gatepost which crunched the hood of a parked car as it fell over People who had been spectating along the fence were scattering from the prospect of having Coffee Nerves out among them The bronc however had rebounded into the arena Piling into that gatepost finally had knocked some of the spunk out of Coffee Nerves He now looked a little groggy and was wobbling somewhat which gave Dill Egan time to lasso him and dally the rope around a corral post This was the scene as I will ever see it Dode Withrow lying out there with the toes of his boots pointing up and Coffee Nerves woozybut defiant at the end of the lasso tether Quite a crowd encircled Dode although Ray and I hung back at its outer exactly what was not needed was any more people in the way 300 Doc Spence forged his way through and I managed to see in past the arms and legs of all the men around him and Dode And saw happen what I so desperately wanted to When Doc held something under Dodes nose Dodes head twitched Before long I heard Dode give a long rnnnmn as if he was terrifically tired After that his eyes came open and he showed that oo was able to move in fact would have tried to sit up if Doc Spence hadnt stopped himo Doe told Dode to just take it easy damn it while he examimd Dodes right leg By nGJ Midge ani t lB Wit hrav girls had scurried out and Midge was dGJ n besid e Dode demanding n You ninny are you all rig ht Dode fastened his look on her and made an rnnnmn again Then burst out loud and clear OOddarnn that stirrup anyway which lightened the mood of all of us around him even Midge looking less warpathlike after that I could just hear the razzing Dode was going to take from his herder Pat Hoy about this forced landing of his Didnt know I was working for an apprentice bronc stamper Dode Want me to saddle up one of these big ewes sos you can practice staying on Relief was all over my father as he went over to the grandstand fence to report to my mother and Marie and Toussaint Ray and I tagged along so we heard it as quick as anybody Doc thinks its a simple leg break my father relayed Could have been a hell of a lot worse Doc s to take him 00 Conrad for overrdg ht just to nake sure My mother at once called out to Midge an off er to ride with her to Conrad Midge though shook her head No I 11 be all right The girlsll be with me no sense in you corning Then I Toussaint was paying no attention to any of this 301 conversation nor to the process of Dode being put on a stretcher over his protestations that he could walk or even footrace if he had to nor to Coffee Nerves being tugged into exit through what little was left of the catch pen gate Instead he Toussaint was standing there gazing into the exact center of the arena as if the extravaganza that Coffee Nerves and Dode had put on still was continuing out there The walnut crinkles deepened in his face his chuckle rippled out and then the declaration That one That one was a ride There of course was more on the schedule of events beyond that Tallie inevitably thought to proclaim Well folks the show goes on But the only way for it to go after that performance by Coffee Nerves and Dode was downhill and Ray and I retained our fence perch just through the next section of calf roping to see whether Alecs seconds would hold up Contestant after contestant rampaged out flailed some air with a lariat and came nowhere close to Alecs time It had been a rodeo English Creek had won both the saddle bronc riding and the calf roping While the rodeo groonds emptied of crMd Ray and I stretched our attendance as long as we could We watered the wrangling crew unpen the broncs and steers and calves Listered to as much of the chute societys post mortem as we could starrl Had ourselves another bottle of pop apiece before the beer booth closed Then I proposed tmt we might as well take a horse tour of Gros Ventre Ray thought that sounded darrly enough so I fetcted Mouse and swung into the saddle an1 Ray clinbed on behim 302 We had sightseen most of the town before wandering back past trn Medicine Lodge which by nai had its front door propped open with a beer keg probably so the accumulating fume of cigarette smoke alcoholic breath wouldnt pop the windows out of the place As Dode Withrow would have said it sounded like Hell changing shifts in there The jabber and laughter and sheer concentration of humanity beyond that saloon doorway of course had Ray and me gazing in as we rode past and that gaze was what made me abruptly halt Mouse Ray didnt ask anything but I could feel his curiosity as to why we were stalled in the middle of the street Nor was it anything I could put into words for him Instead I offered 11How about you riding Mouse down to your place Ill be along in a little Theres somebody I got to go see Rays look toward the Medicine Lodge wondered In there but his voice only conveyed Sure glad to and he lifted himself ahead into the saddle after I climbed down Best of both worlds for him chance to be an unquestioning friend and get a horse to ride as well I went into the blue air of the saloon and stopped by the figure sitting on the second bar stool inside the doorway The Medicine Lodge was getting itself uncorked for the night ahead Above the general jabber somebody toward the middle of the bar was relating in a semishout So I told that sonofabitch he just better watch his step around me or theres gonna be a new face in Hell for breakfast My interest though was entirely here at the seated figure The brown hat moved around as he became aware of me 303 Lo Stanley I began still not knowing where I was going next with any of this Well there Jick The crowfoot lines clutched deeper at the corners of Stanley Meixells eyes as he focused on me He didnt look really tanked up but on the other hand couldnt be called churchsober either Someplace in between as hed been so much of our time together on the mountain Havent seen you he continued in all pleasantness since you started living aboveground Good Christ Stanley had nqticed my ducking act that day I was digging the outhouse hole and he rode by Was my every moment visible to people anymore like a planet being perpetually studied by one of those California telescopes Yeah well How you been Fine as snoose And yourself What I mean hows your hand doing Stanley looked down at it as if I was the first to ever point out its He still had some doozies of scabs arrl rrajor bruises there on the injury site but Stanley didn 1 t seem to regard this as anythiqs but ordimry health It aint bad He picked up tre bottle of beer fran tre collllter before him Works good enough for too basics anyway Am tipped down tre last of tha t particular beer Can I buy you a snort No no thanks On the wagon huh Ive clumb on it some times myself All else considered though Id just as soon be down off It occurred to me that since I was in this place anyway it didnt cost any more to be cordial The stool between Stanley and the doorway 304 was vacantan empty mixeddrink glass testified that its occupant had traveled onso I straddled the seat and amended Actually I would take a bottle of orange though Stanley indicated his empty beer bottle to Tom Harry the nearest of the three bartenders trying to cope with the crowds liquid wants When you get time professor And a sunjuice for my nurse here Tom Harry studied me He with you he asked Stanley Closer than kin him and me Stanley solemnly vouched to the barman We have rode millions of miles together None of it aged him that much Tom Harry observed nonetheless setting up a bottle of orange in front of me and a fresh beer for Stanley Stanley I started again He was pushing coins out of a little pile to pay for the latest round Fishing up a fivecent piece he held it toward me between his thumb and forefinger Know what this is Sure a nickel Naw its a dollar a Scotchmans been squeezing The fresh beer got a gulp of attention For the sake of the conversation I intended Id like to have known how many predecessors that bottle had had but of course Tom Harrys style of bartending was to swoop empties out of sight so no such incriminating count could be taken I didnt have long to dwell on Stanleys possible intake for some outoftown guy wearing a panama hat zigged when he meant to zag on his way toward the door and lurched into the pair of us Abruptly the 305 guy was being gripped just above the elbow by Stanleyhis right hand evidently had recuperated enough from Bubbles for this tooand was retargeted toward the door with advice from Stanley Step easy buddy so you donJt get yourself hurt In this county theres a 5 fine for drawing blood on a fool hastily Mr Panama HOatlleft our company and Stanleys handling of the incident reminded me to ask something How you getting along with Canada Dan these days Better Stanley allowed Yeah just a whole lot better He paid recognition to his beer bottle again Last I heard Dan was up in Cut Bank Doing some town herding Cut Bank Town herding What did the Busby boys can him I got them to give Dan a kind of vacation Then in afterthought Permanent I considered this Up there in the Two with Stanley those weeks ago I would not have bet a pin that he was capable of rousing himself to do justice to Canada Dan Yet he had Stanley I can tell you got something on your mind Jick Might as well unload it If I could grapple it into position that was exactly what I intended To ask what was that all about when we first met you there on the mountain the skittishness between you and my father Why when I ask anyone in this family of mine about Stanley Meixell is there never a straight answer Just who are you to us How did 306 you cross paths with the McCaskills in the past and why are you back crisscrossing with us again Somebody just beyond Stanley let out a whoop then started in on a twangy renditicin of the song that goes Im a calico dog Im a razorback hog Im a cowboy on the loose I can drink towns dry I can all but fl I flavor m beans with snoose In an instant Tom Harry was there leaning over the bar and with a pointed finger informing the songster that he didnt care if the guy hooted howled or for that matter blew smoke rings out his butt but no singing This Stanley shook his head over wnats the world coming to when a man cant offer up a tune They ruin everything these days First Dode now Stanley It seemed my mission in life this Fourth of July to steer morose beer drinkers away from even deeper gloom At least I knew which direction I wanted to point Stanley back into history I been trying to figure something out I undertook honestly enough one more time Stanley why was it you quit rangering on the Two Stanley did some more demolition on his beer then cast a visiting glance around the walls at Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the stuffed herd and eventually had to look at me and ask as if verifying Me Uh huh you No special reason Run it by me anyway 307 Naw youd be bored fast Whynt you let me judge that You got better use for your ears Jesus Stanley All this while I was attempting to pry sense out of Stanley the tail of my eye was trying to tell me something again Someone had come up behind me Which wasnt particular news in the Medicine Lodge throng except this someone evidently had no other site in mind his presence stayed steadily there close enough to make me edgy about it sitting halfbraced as I was in case this guy too was going to crash in our direction I on the bar stool to cope with the interloper and gazed full into the face not all that many inches away of Velma Simms I must tell you it was like opening a kitchen drawer to reach in for a jelly spoon and finding instead the crown jewels of England For I had never been close enough headon to Velma to learn that her eyes were gray Gray Like mine Possibly our four were the worlds only And to garner further that her lipstick on the very lips that ruled the rodeo whistle was the beautiful darkbeyondred of ripe cherries And that she was wearing tiny pearl earrings below the chestnut hair as if her ears could be unbuttoned to further secrets even there And that while the male population of northern Montana was focusing on the backside of Velmas renowned slacks they were missing important announcements up front Sure there could be found a few 1neelelines at the corners of her eyes and across her 308 forehead But to me r4h t then they simply seemed to be affidavits of hM imginative a life this lady had ledo Unbelievable but so Out of all too crowded flesh in the Medicine Lodge just then solely onto me was fixed this attention of Velma Simms She just stood there eyeing me while I gaped until the point of her attention finally prodded through to me Oh Oh hello Mrsuh Velma Have I got your seat I scrambled off the bar stool as if it was suddenly redhot Now that you mention it she replied and even just saying that her words were one promissory note after another Velma floated past me and snuggled onto the stool A little extra of that snuggle went in Stanleys directiqn Saw you there at the announcing booth I reminisced brightly Did you said she I may be a slow starter but eventually I catch up with the situation My quick gawp around the saloon confirmed what had been trying to dawn on me This years beau in the gabardine suit was nowhere Yeah well I began to extricate myself I got to be getting Dont feel you need to rush off said Stanley As if Gods gift to the male race wasnt enthroned right there beside him The nights still a pup Uh huh Thats true but When you got to go put in Velma twirling the empty mixeddrink glass to catch Tom Harrys attention for a refill you got to go 309 Right I affirmed And like I say I uh got to go What made me add to the total of my footprints already in my mouth I cant truly account for Maybe the blockade I had hit again in wanting to ask all the questions of Stanley In any case the parting I now blurted out was You two in a dancing mood tonight What I mean see you at the dance will I Stanley simply passed that inquiry to Velma with a look In theory Velma then spoke her answer to me although she didnt unlock her gaze from him at all as she said it Stanley and I will have to see whether we have any spare time So One more topic clambering aboard my already bentover brain Stanley Meixell and Velma Croake Bogan Sutter Simms Ray What kind of a summer are you having up We were n the double window of his bedroom each of us propped within the sill A nice breeze came in on us there the leaves of the big cottonwood in the Heaneys front yard seeming to flutter the air our way Downstairs the radio had just been turned on by Ed Heaney so it was 7 oclock dance wouldnt get underway for an hour or so yet and as long as Ray and I were going to be window sitting anyway for the next while I figured Id broach to him some of all that was on my mind Didnt I tell you Pilot No I dont mean that What it isdo things seem to you kind of 310 unsettled How Well Christ I dont know Just in general People behaving likethey dont khow whether to include you in or out of things What kind of things Things that went on years ago Say there was an argument or a fight or something people fell out over it Why cant they just say heres what it was about its over and done with Get it out of their systems Thats just grownfups Theyre not going to let a kid in on anything until they figure its too late to do him any good But why is that What is it thats so goddamn important back there that they have to keep it to themselves Jick sometimes What Sometimes maybe you think too much I thought that over briefly wbat am I supposed to do about that Christ Ray its not like poking your finger up your nose in public some kind of habit you can remind yourself not to do Thinking is thinking It happens in spite of a person Yeah but you maybe encourage it more than it needs I what See maybe its like this Rays eyes squinched more than ever as he worked on his notion and the big front teeth nipped his lower lip in concentration Then Maybe lets say maybe a thought comes 311 into your head its only about what youre going to do next Saddle up Mouse and take a ride say Thats all the thought it really needs put on the saddle and climb on But the mood youre in Jick youd stop first think some more But if I go for a ride where am I going to go rn Ray here went into one of his radio voices the words coming deep and crowding each other fast like Kaltenborns What is it Ill see when I get there Did anybody else ever see it And if anybody did is it going to look the same to me as it did to them And old Mouse here is it going to look the same to Mouse as it does to me Raymond Edmund Heaney Von Kaltenborn broke off and it was just Ray again On and on that way Jick If you think too much you make it into a whole dictionary of going for a ride Instead of just going See what Im saying Goddamn it now Ray what I mean is more important than goddamn riding a horse Its the same with anything Itll get to you if you think about it too much Jick But what Im telling you is I dont have any choice This stuff Im talking about is on my mind whether or not I want it to be Ray took a look at me as if I had some sort of brain fever that might be read in my face Then in another of his radio voices intoned Have you tried Vicks VapoRub It sooooothes as it wooooorks There it lay Even Ray had no more idea than the man in the moon about my perplexity This house where we sat tucked in bluepainted sills above its broad lawned yard and under its high cottonwoods this almost second home of mine it ticked to an entirely different time than the summer that was coursing through me The Heaney family was in place in the world Ed was going to go on exiting the door of his lumber yard at 6 every evening and picking up his supper fork at 10 after 6 and clicking on that Philco radio at 7 on into eternity Genevieve would go on keeping this house shining and discovering new sites for doilies Mary Ellen would grow up and learn nursing at the Columbus Hospital in Great Falls Ray would grow up and take a year of business college at Missoula and then join his father in the lumber yard Life under this roof had the rhythm of the begattings in the Bible The Heaneys were not the McCaskills not even anywhere similar and I lacked the language to talk about any of the difference even to my closest friend 313 Swing swing andswing em high Allemande left and allemande aye Inge bingo six penny high Big pig little pig root hog or die The dance was underway but only just when Ray and I wandered down there to the Sedgwick House to it Which is to say the I suppose old even Lila Sedge conceived of it as a ballroom but everybody else considered it the dance hallwas crammed to an extent that made the Medicine Lodge look downright lonely across the street but not all that many people were dancing yet Visiting an eyeful of circulating elseJ joking trying to pry out of a neighbor how many bushels an acre his wheat looked like or what his lambs weighed by now but only one square of actual dancers out there footing it to Jerome Satterlees calling Partly everybody knew it took Jerome a little while translate that to a few drinks to get his tonsils limbered up And then he could call dances until your shoes fell off your feet A little thin out here on the floor it looks to me like Jerome was now declaring preparatory to the next dance You know what I mean Lets get one more square going here make it look like we mean business Adam Sal step on out here you can stand around and gab any time How about all you Busbys youre half a square yourselves Good good Corne on now one more couple Nola plays this piano twice as good when we got two squares on the floor At the upright Nola Atkins sat planted as if theyd simply picked up the piano bench from 314 the creek picnic with her on it and set them both here on the band platform Beside her Jeff Swan had his fiddle tucked under his chin and his bow down at his side as if it was a sword he was ready to draw One more couple Do I have to telephone to Valier and ask them to send over four left feet Whup here they come now straight from supper dancers if I ever saw any Leona Tracy and Alec McCaskill step right in there Alec you checked your horse and rope at the door I hope Now this is somewhat more like Stepping in from the Sedgwick House dining room rodeo prize money in his pocket and free supper under his belt and a grin everywhere on his face there was any space for it Alec looked like a young king coming home from his crowning ceremony Even so to notice this glorious brother of mine you had to ately steer your eyes past Leona Talk about an effort of will Leona took the shine in any crowd even a dance hall full The days green blouse was missing mean she had changed out of it Now she wore a white taffeta dress full and flouncy at the hem In square dancing a lot of swirling goes on and Leona was going to be a swirl worth seeing I shot a glance around the dance hall My parents had missed this grand entry Theyd gone out to JL and Nan Hills ranch a couple of miles up English Creek for supper and to change clothes and were taking their own sweet time about getting back in And Pete and Marie were driving Toussaint home to the Two Medicine so theyd be even later arriving I was the sole family representative so to speak 315 to record the future Mr and Mrs Alec McCaskill come swanking in Ready out there Sure you are Youll get to liking this so much before the night is out youll want to trade your bed for a lantern Jerome when he got to going good put a lot of motion into his calling using both arms to direct the traffic of dancers kind of like a man constantly hanging things here and there in a closet His gestures even now said he was entering into the spirit of the night All right sonnies and honeys Nola Jim lets make em prance Everybody here we go First four Back to your places Second four Shuffle on back Now youre getting down to cases swing each other till thefloorbeams crack Rere in the time L am now it seems hard to credit that this Fourth of July dance the first I ever went to on my own That is was in company with somebody like Ray instead of being along as baggage with my parents Of course without fully acknowledging it Ray and I also were well on our way to another tremendous night the one when each of us would step through this dance hall doorway with a person neither parent nor male alongside But that lay await yet My point just now is that where L was in life this particular Fourth night closing in on if teen years of age L had been attending dances since the first few months of that total And Alec the allwinning rodeoshirted sashayer out there on the floor right now the same before me Each a McCaskill baby bundled in blankets and cradled in chairs beside the dance floor 316 Imbibe music along with mothers milk that was the experience of a lot of us of Two country upbringing Successors to Alecs and my side infancy were here in the Sedgwick House hall this very night Charity Frews halfyearold daughter and another new Helwig baby and a couple of other fresh ones belonging to farm folks east of town a swaddled quartet with chairs fenced around them in the farthest corner of the dance hall Salute your ladies all together Ladies to the gents do the same Hit the lumber with your leather Balance all and swing your dame It might be said that the McCaskill dancing history was such that it was the portion of lineage that came purest into Alec and me Definitely into Alec there now with that white taffeta back and forth to him like a wave of the sea he looked like he could romp on forever What little I knew of my fathers father the first McCaskill to caper on Americas soil instead of Scotlands included the mation that he could dance down the house Schottisches and Scotch reels in particular but he also adopted any western square dances In his twinkling steps so to speak followed my mother and father Dances held in ranch houses my mothertobe arriving on horseback with her party dress tied on behind the saddle my fathertobe performing the Scotch Heaven ritual of scattering a little oatmeal on the floor for better gliding Schoolhouse dances In the face of the Depression even hard times dances the women costumed in gunnysack dresses and the men 317 in tattered work clothes And now Alec the latest McCaskill dancer and me beginning to realize I was on my way Bunch the ladies there in the middle you gents and dosie doe Pay attention to old Jeffs fiddle Swing her around and away you go It comes to me that around this exact same piece of time I am telling about maybe even that same year I first read what I always think of in this dancing respect It was when the Irish poet Yeats died and the At Random page of the Gleaner had a story on his life From his picture the man looked like an uppity sonofagun wearing those pinchnose eyeglasses but I read the piece just to be reading something And gained for all time the lines that lay at the end of that story Oh hands clapped to music oh brightening glance How can we tell the dancer from the dance Which ever since has seemed to me so fascinating so right I almost wish I had never come across it For those words make one of those questions that slip into your mind every time you meet up with the circumstances they suggest It was so then even as Ray nudged me to point out the Busby brothers going through a fancy twirl with each other instead of with their wives and I joined Ray and everybody else in laughing and it is so now Within all else that Irishmans question a kind of beautiful haunting But I suppose that is what poets and for that matter dances and dancers are for 318 Gentstothe center ladies roundthem Form a circle balance all Whirl your girls to where you found them Promenade all around the hall This concluding promenade brought Alec and Leona over toward where Ray and I were onlooking and spying us they trooped right up Lord of mercy Leona in the flush of the pleasure of dancing was nearly more than the eyes could stand I know Ray shifted a little nervously beside me and maybe I did too Mister Jick again she greeted me At least it wasnt Hello she bestaled on Ray John Angus And Raymond Edmund Heaney which really did set Ray to shifting around So high in flight was Alec tonight though that nobody else had to expend much effort A lank of his rich red hair was down across his forehead from the dancing and the touch of muss just made him look handsomer 1Heres a pair of wall guards he observed of Ray and me while he grinned mightily You guys better think about getting yourselves one of these things giving Leona a waist squeeze Yeah sure right As if Leonas were as plenty as blackberries I have wondered of ten If Marcella Withrow had been on hand that night instead of at the Conrad hospital with her father would Ray have nerved himself up and squired her out onto the floor But if you cant carry on conversation with your own brother who can you So to keep mouth matters in motion I asked How was it Alec peered at me and he let up on that Leona squeezing How 319 was what Supper The supper you won for handcuffing that poor little calf Dandy he reported just dandy And now Leona awarded him a squeeze in Whatd you have veal Ray put in which I thought was pretty good But Alec and Leona were so busy handling each others waists they didnt catch it and Alec said Naw steaks Dancing fuel He looked down at his armful of Leona Speaking of which TIMMBERRR I was not the only one whose ears almost dropped off in surprise That cry was a famous one at any dance such as this It dated back to Prohibition days and what it signalled back then whenever somebody t W stuck his headjthrough too dame hall doorway arxl cut loose the call was tll3 availability of Mason jar moons hire for anybody who cared to step outside for a sipo So my surprise was double That the cry resounded through the hall this night and that the timber crier there in the doorway when I spun around to see proved to be my father with my mother on his arm He wore his brown pinstripe suit coat a white shirt and his newest Levis She was in her blue cornflower frock with the slight V neckline it was pretty tame by todays standards but did display enough of throat and breastbone to draw second glances Togged out that way Varick and Lisabeth McCaskill made a prime pair as rangers and wives often did 320 Calls and claps greeted my fathers solo Youd be the one to know Mac Hoot mon Scotch Heaven has come to town1 Beth tell us fair and square has he been up in the Two practicing that Even Alec wagged his head inadmiration consternation both and morebefore declaiming to Leona Theres dancing to be done Lets get at it before the rowdy element cuts loose with something more Ray and I sifted over to my parents side of the hall My father was joshing Fritz Hahn that if Dode could still ride a bronc like that it was Fritzs turn next Fourth to uphold the South Fork reputation Greta and my mother were trading laughter over something too Didnt I tell you a dance is the McCaskill version of bliss Here they are the future of the race my father greeted Ray and me Ray howre you summeringZ Real good Ray responded along with his parenthetical grin Quite a rodeo wasnt it Quite a one my father agreed with a little shake of his head which I knew had to do with the outcome of the calf roping But at once he was launched back into more visiting with Fritz and Ray and I just parked myself and inventoried him and my mother It was plain my father had timbered a couple of drinkshis left eyelid was down a little as if listening to a nightlong jokebut no serious amount My mother though My mother too looked bright as a butterfly and as she and my father traded gab with the Hahns and other people who happened by to say good words about oo r Ben Er lish speech or his timber whoop 321 both her and him unable to keep from glancing at the backandforth of the dancers more than at their conversationalists a suspicion seeded in me Maybe more than maybe my mother had a drink or two in her too Where you guys been I voiced when I got the chance And received what I deserved Places stated my mother then laughed Well Id had one escape this day Getting in and out of the Medicine Lodge without coinciding with my own parents there Out on the floor the swirl was dissolving as it does after the call and music have hit their climax and Jerome was enlisting body within earshot for the next variety of allemande and dosie doe Now I cant call dances to an empty floor can I Lets up the ante here Four squares this time lets make it Plenty of territory we dont even have to push out the walls yet The man needs our help my father suggested to my mother and the Hahns and off they all went to take up places in the fourth square of dancers forming up The dance wove the night to a pattern all its own as dances do I remember the standard happenings Supper hour was announced for midnight both the Sedgwick House dining room and the Lunchery were going to close at one am Ray and I had agreed that supper houror rather an invitation to oyster stew at the Lunchery as my parents were certain to providewould be our personal curfew Jerome at one point sang out Next one is ladies choice and it was interesting to 322 see some of the selections they made Alice Van Bebber snagging the lawyer Eli Kinder and immediately beginning to talk him dizzy pretty Arleta Busby putting out her hand to that big pile of guff Ed Van Bebber of all damn people My parents too made South Fork pairings my mother going over to Fritz Hahn Greta Hahn coupling onto my fathers arm Then after one particularly rousing floor session Jerome announced that if anyone cared to pass a hat he and the musicians could manage to look the other way and collection was taken to pay him and Nola and Jeff Cf As I say all this was standard enough and mingled with it were some particularities of this night The arrival of Good Help and Florene Hebner magically a minute or so after the hat had been passed Florene still was a presentable looking woman despite a dress that had been washed to half its original color Good Helps notion of dressing up was to top off his overalls with a flat cap My mother once commented A poorboy cap and less under it The departure of the grocery store family the Helwigs with Luther Helwig wobbling grievously under the load of booze he had been taking on and his wife Erna beside him with the bawling baby plucked from the far end chair corral In such a case you always have to wonder was a strategic motherly pinch delivered to that baby My inspiration for Ray and me to kill off the last of my fifty cent stake with a bottle of pop apiece How about stepping across for something wet was the way I proposed it to Ray He took on a worried look and began I dont know that my folks want me going in that Christ not the Medicine Lodge I relieved him I meant the Lunchery And through 323 it all dance after dance after dance my tall redheaded father and my whitethroated mother in the musical swim at one end of the hall my tall redheaded brother and Leona starring at the other end It was in fact when Ray and I returned from our pop stop that we found a lull in the dancing and made our way over to my parents again to be as convenient as possible for an oyster stew invite I suppose you two could eat if you had to my father at once settled that issue while my mother drew deep breaths and cast a look around the hallfull Having fun I asked her just to be asking something while my father was joshing Ray about being girlless on such a night A ton she confinned Just then Jerome Satterlee appeared in our midst startling us all a little to see him up close instead of on the platform What did you come down for air Jerome my father kidded Now dont give an old man a hard time responded Jerome Call this next one how about Mac Then we can turn em loose for supper Myself I got to go see a man about a dog My father was not at all a square dance caller of Jeromes breadth But he was known to be good atwell I will have to call it a sort of Scotch cadence a beat of the kind that a bagpipe and drum band puts out Certainly you danced smoother to Jeromes calling but my fathers could bring out stamping and clapping and other general exuberation I think it is not too much to say that with my eyes closed and ears stuffed I could have stood there in the Sedgwick 324 House and told you whether it was Jerome or my father calling the dance just by the feel of how feet were thumping the hall floor To make sure their smooth terms could stand his absence my father looked the question at my mother and she told him by a nod that he ought to go do the call She even added Why dont you do the Dude and Belle This time of night everybody can stand some perking up He climbed onto the band platform Lo Nola Jeff This isnt any idea of mine understand Been saving you the best strings of this fiddle Mac Jeff answered When youre ready Nola nodded echoed When youre ready All right then Try make me look like I know what Im doing My father tipped his left shoulder down pumped a rhythm with his heel a number of times to get a feel of the platform Then made a loud hollow clap with his hands which brought everybodys attention and called out over the hall Jerome is taking a minute to recuperate He said he hates to turn things over to anybody with a Scotch notion of music but saw no choice So youre in for it What one we gonna do Mac the Two Medicine twostep some wit yelled out No sir Ive got orders to send you to supper hour in style Time to do the Dude and Belle And lets really do it six squares worth My father was thinking big Six squares of dancers in this hall would swash from wall to wall and end to end and onlookers already were 325 moving themselves into the doorway or alongside the band platform to grant space All right You all knowhow it starts Join hands and circle left Even yet I am surprised that I propelled myself into doing it I stepped away from Ray soldiered myself in front of my mother and said ff Mrs McCaskill I dont talk through my nose as pretty as the guy you usually gallivant around with But suppose I could have this dance with you anyway Her face underwent that rinse of surprise that my father sometimes showed about her She cast a look toward the top of my head as if just realizing my height Then came her sidelong smile and her announcementfff I never could resist you McCaskill galoots Arm in arm my mother and I took a place in the nearest square People were marshalling everywhere in the hall it looked like a major parade forming up Another thunderclap from my fathers hands Nola and Jim opened up with the music and my father chanted us into action First gent swing the lady so fair Now the one right over there Now the one with the sorrel hair Now the belle of the ballroom Swirl and twirl And promenade all Second gent swing thelady firstrate Besides my mother and me our square was Bob and Arleta Busby and Musgreaves ran the drugstore and luck of luck Pete and Marie 326 back from returning Toussaint to the Two Medicine and dancing hard the past hour or so to make up for time lost All of them but me probably had done the Dude and Belle 500 times in their lives but its a basic enough dance that I knew the ropes You begin with everybody joining handsmy mothers firm feel at the end of one of my arms Arletas small cool hand at my other extremeand circling left a wheel of eight of us spinning to the music Now to my fathers call of youve done the track now circle back the round chain of us goes into reverse prancing back to where we started Swing your partner my mothers cornflower frock a blue whirlwind around the pair of us Now the lady on the left which in my instance meant hooking arms with Arleta another first in my life Now return to partner all couples do some sashaying right and left and the gent of this round steps forth and begins swinging the ladies in turn until hes back to his own partner And with all gusto swings her as the Belle of the Ballroom Third gent swing the lady in blue What I would give to have seen all this through my fathers eyes Presiding up there on the platform pumping rhythm with his heel and feeling it multiplied back to him by the 48 feet traveling the dance floor Probably if you climbed the helmet spike of the Sedgwick House the rhythm of those six squares of dancers would have come quivering up to you like spasms through a tuning fork Figure within figure within figure from my fathers outlook over us the kaleidoscope of six simultaneous dance patterns and inside each the hinged couple 327 of the instant and comprising those couples friends neighbors sons wife with flashing throat Oh hands clapped to music hands of my McCaskill father and oh brightening glance glance of my McCaskill mother and no inthat hall aswim in motion and music dancer could never be told from dance nFourth gent swing the 1ady so sweet The fourth gent was me I stepped to the center of our square again made the fit of arms with Arleta Busby and swung her Now the one with dairtty f eet0 Musgreave as a partridge didnt exactly fit the prescription but again I managed sending her puffing out of our fast swirl Now the orte who looks so neat Marie glided forth solemnly winked at me and spun about me light as a ghost Now the Belle of the Ballroom The blue beauty my mother Swirl and twirl Didnt we though 1Now promenade all 11 Around we went all the couples and now it was the womens turn to court their Dudes First lady swing the gent whos got sore toes Now the one with the great big nose Nowthe one who wears store clothes Now the dude of the ballroom 328 Second lady swing the gent in size thirteens Now the one that ate the beans Now the one in brand new jeans Now the dude of the ballroom Third lady swing the gent with the lantern jaw now the one from Arkansas Now the one that yells Ah

performed for our square with a dandy of a whoop Fourth lady swing the gent whose nose is blue My mother and sallow Hugh Musgreave0 Now theone that spilled the gluen Reese reflections dancing with each other my mother and Pete Now the one whos stuck on you11 lier and Bob Busby two of the very best dancers in the whole hall liNow the Dude of the Ballroom She came for me eyes on mine I was the proxy of all that had begun at another dance at the Noon Creek schoolhouse twenty years before My f atl1er s voice 11Swirl him and twirl him My moment of Dudehood was an almighty whirl as if my mother had been getting up the 329 momentum all night All j oirt hands and circle to the left Before the fiddler starts to swear Dudes and Belles youve done your best Now oromenade to you know where Didnt know you were a lightfoot Ray greeted me at the edge of the throng heading through the doorway to supper hour Me neither I responded blowing a little My mother was with Pete and Marie right behind me we all would have to wait for my father to make his way from the band platform Lets let them catch up with us outside I can use some air Ray and I squirmed along between the crowd and the lobby wall weaseling our way until we popped out the front entry of the Sedgwick House I was about to say here that the next historic event of this Fourth of July Gros Ventre category was underway as the two of us emerged into the night well ahead of my parents and the Reeses But given that midnight had already happened Id better call this the first occurrence of July 5 The person most innnediately obvious of course was Leona white and gold in the frame of light cast onto the street by the Sedgwick Houses big lobby window And then Arlee Zane also there on that raft of light Arlee ignorance shining from every pore Beyond them a bigger two with the reflected light cutting a line 330 across their chests face to face in the dimness above that as if they were carrying on the nicest of private chats Except that the beamf rame build of one and the chokecherry shirt of the other showed them to be Earl Zane and Alec and therefore they were not chatting Surprised to see you without a skim milk calf on the end of a string Earl was offering up as Ray and I sidled over beside Leona and Arlee so as not to miss anything Inspiring Arlee to laugh big as if Earls remark deserved it What are you out here in the night looking for that cinnamon pony I give Alec credit for the easy way he said this tossing it out as a joke He went thataway Earl Earl proved not to be in the market for humor just now however I suppose you could have forked him any better You could all but hear the thick gears move in Earls head to produce the next remark You likely had a lot of riding practice recently Earl you lardbrain this drew from Leona But Alec chose to cash Earls remark at face value Some of us do get paid to stay on horses instead of bailing off of them Come onLeona lets go get us some supper before the dancing starts again Earl now had another brain movement Surprised you can dance at all these days what with marriage on your mind He leaned a little toward Alec to deliver the final part Tell me this McCaskill Has it ever climbed out the top of your pants yet That one I figured was going to be bingo After all anybody who has grown up in Montana has seen Scotch lawsuits get underway for a 331 lot less connnentary than that At dances the situation was connnon enough almost to be a regular feature One guy with a few too many drinks in him calls some other guy a name none too fond and that party responds with a fist Of course the connnotion was generally harsher than the combat but black eyes and bent noses could result Earl you jugheaded Leona was responding but to my considerable disappointment Alec interrupted her by simply telling Earl Stash it sparrowhead Come on Leona we got business elsewhere I bet you got business all right Earl adventured on Leona business Snatch a kiss kiss a snatch all the same to you McCaskill aint it I cant truly say I saw it happen Not in any way of following a sequence this and then this and then this No the event simply arrived into my mind complete intact engraved before its realization could make itself felt Versions of anything of this sort are naturally suspect of course Like that time Dempsey fought Gibbons up at Shelby for the heavyweight championship Forty thousand people were there and afterward about a quarter millin could provide you an eyewitness account But I will relate just as much of this Earl and Alec episode as I can vouch for One instant Earl was standing there admiring the manufacture of his last connnent and then in the next instant was bent in half giving a nasty tossingup noise auheughhh that made my own stomach turn over What can have inspired Alec given that the timehonored McCaskill procedure after loss of temper was to resort to a roundhouse right to 332 deliver Earl that short straight jab to the solar plexus How much that economical punch of Alecs yielded Every bit of this I can see as if it were happening over again right now Earl now in full light doubled down as he was Alec stepping around him to collect Leona and the supper crowd in its long file out of the Sedgwick House stopping and gawking GodDAMN exploded between Ray and me Arlee pushing through and haynaker combining his oath with the start of on Alecs passing jaw Targeted but undelivered On the far side of Arlees girth from me Ray reached up almost casually it seemed and latched onto Arlees wrist The intended swing went nowhere after that Ray hanging onto the wouldbe swingster as if hed just caught him with that hand in the cookie jar and by the time Arlee squared around and managed to begin to tussle in earnest with Raythank heaven for the clomping quality of the Zane brain1 had awarded Arlee a bit of a shove to worry him from my side Where would progressed beyond that I have ever beencurious about In hindsight that is For if Arlee had managedto shake out of Rays grip he was elephant enough to provide us both some pounding1f But by now my father was on hand and Pete and two or three other men soldiered out of the crowd to help sort us into order and somebody was fetching Tallie Zane out of the Medicine Lodge on Earls behalf 333 Jick thats enough my father instructed Turn him loose Ray Its over This too I am clear about Those sentences to Ray and me were the full sum of what was said by any McCaskill here in this aftermath What traveled to Alec from my father was a stare a studying one there in the frame of hotel light as if my father was trying to be sure this was the person he thought it was And got back from Alec one of the identical calibre Then Leona was in the grasp of my brother and my mother stepped out alongside my father and each couple turned and went Ray What We were side by side in bed in the dark of his room Outside the open twin windows a breeze could be heard teasing its way through the leaves of the giant cottonwood You helped a lot there at the dance Thats okay Youll want to watch out Arlee doesnt try get it back on you Yeah There was silence then and the dark until Ray startled me with something between a giggle and a laugh What the hell now I couldnt see what he was doing but as soon as words started issuing from him I knew He was pinching his nose closed He wants to watch out around me came droning out in 334 exact imitation of Tallies rodeo announcing or Ill cut his heart out and drink his blood That got me into the act With a good grasp on my nose I proposed in the same tinny tonefJ Yank off his arm and make him d shake hands with it Ray giggled and offered1 Grab him by the epiglommis until his eyes pooch out Sharpen the point on his head I paused for my own giggles and pound him in like a post Kick enough crap out of him to daub a log barn Ray envisioned Goddamn booger eater him anyhow With each atrocity on Arlee our laughing multiplied until the bed was shaking and we tried to tone things down before Rays folks woke up and wondered just what was going every time we got ourselves nearly under control one or the other of us erupted againthump old Arlee as far into Hellon and on laughing anew snorting it out in spite of ourselvesas a bird can fly in a lif etimesides shaking and throats rollicking until we were almost sick and then of course we had to laugh at the ridiculousness of that Nor when Ray finally did play out and conked off to sleep did that fever of humor entirely leave me I would doze for a while and then be aware I was grinning openeyed into the darkness about one or another moment of that immense day that nevercanbeforgotten Fourth 335 Here I rest world as happy as if I had good sense and the patent on remembrance My mother on the park stump giving her Ben English speech and Dode at the top of that leap by Coffee Nerves and my father calling out the Dude and Belle to the dancing crowd and my brother onepunching Earl Zane and Ray pitching in on Arlee and you bet Stanley Meixell collecting Velma Simms Scene by scene they fell into place in me smooth as kidskin and exact as chapter and verse every one a perfect piece of that day and now of the night A set of hours worth the price of the rest of the life those To wake up chuckling give the dark a great Chessy cat grin and drop off until my own laughter woke me again
